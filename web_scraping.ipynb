            "Unfortunately, exercise isn't always enough to get amazing abs. You may get strong ab muscles from an intense ab and core workout, but if your new muscles are covered up by belly fat, you won't get the visual results you're going for. To burn fat, it may be necessary to make certain lifestyle changes so that you run a  calorie deficit  - that is, you use more calories than you take in.To begin, try to change your current daily routine so that you use more calories throughout the day. If, for instance, you drive to school or work, try biking or running instead. If you spend most of your free time watching TV, try signing up for a local amateur sports team or simply going for a jog. Over the long term, these minor changes can help you cut down on lingering body fat, making your abs much more defined.\n",
            "Cut down on calories.\n",
            "One sure-fire way to lose weight is simply to eat less. There is debate about how often and how much you should eat for optimal weight loss - the most important thing to remember for weight loss is simply to take in fewer calories from food than you use throughout the day. Calculate your basal metabolic rate, then count the calories from the food you eat throughout the day.A healthy weight loss goal is to lose about one or two pounds a week. One pound of fat is 3500 calories. To lose a pound a week, you need to cut 500 calories per day from your diet.Make sure that any diet you plan to participate in is [7]realistic, sensible, and safe. You need to eat at least 1200 calories a day. Don't starve yourself or neglect your nutrition, or you may seriously endanger your health.\n",
            "Change the types of food you eat.\n",
            "When it comes to dieting, it's not all about how much you eat - it's also about  what  you eat. Try to cut as many processed foods as you can out of your diet - as a general rule, if you can't immediately tell what plant or animal food was made from, it probably counts as \"processed.\" Also, try to cut out high-fat and high-sugar dishes. Instead, supplement your diet with vegetables (especially high-nutrient vegetables like kale and spinach) whole-grain carbs, lean protein (yogurt, chicken breast, eggs, and certain fish, for instance), and limited amounts of healthy fats (like olive oil, avocado, and nuts.)Drink as much water as you can! It's refreshing, zero-calorie, and it's been found to promote weight loss.[8]\n",
            "Do cardio.\n",
            "Cardio (or \"aerobic\") exercise is a great way to burn fat. Intense cardio workouts, like running, swimming, and cycling, burn lots of calories. If you're looking to burn fat, consider devoting time each week to cardio exercise. It's a great way to widen the gap between the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use every day. However, beware - if you increase the amount of food you eat in response to a new cardio routine, you may not burn fat.[9]As with most forms of exercise, pursue a new cardio routine with moderation. Don't go overboard - if you devote all your time to cardio and none of your time to strength-building exercise, eating healthy, and resting, you may exhaust yourself and be left with disappointing results.\n",

After pouring, use a measuring tape to make sure the distance between the top of the sand and your slope line equals the height of one paver.[15]You can also lay a pipe that's the same thickness as the pavers on the sand to make sure the distance between the sand and slope lines is accurate.\n",

Once the hiding-under-the-covers phase is over, the process can start. But there's a definite linear process to letting go, and the hiding-under-the-covers phase (also known as the crying-over-a-tub-of-ice-cream phase or the less work-friendly dying-your-hair-a-strange-color phase) has to come first. Let it.The first thing you'll probably feel is denial, followed by anger. It won't sink in as real and then when it does, the words that were exchanged and the exchanges that were had will evoke frustration and pain. Instead of tormenting yourself not only for the break up but for how you're handling the break up, know that this is how it works. These emotions you're feeling are a part of you. You're not crazy and you're not worthless. You're just human.\n",

But if you had the person back, 10 minutes later you'd be thinking, \"That's right. That's why it wasn't working.\" It's just hard to remember all the crap when you're caught up in such intense emotion. Know that if you do find yourself pining over great memories, you're not seeing it realistically. If you need some science to back it up, know that emotion is proved to affect memory. So when you're searching desperately for the good, your mind may even formulate new twists to meet your current expectations. Basically, your memory is putting on rose-colored glasses to meet your current thought process.\n",

            "\"Letting go\" is basically a euphemism for forgetting. For not giving a care, anymore. This sounds a little harsh, so that's why it's given the friendlier term. That being said, distancing yourself from the person is the only way you can get on the fast-track to forgetting. You know that shirt you found in the back of your closet that made you say, \"Oh my god, I loved this shirt! How in the world did I not realize it was missing?\" Yep. Out of sight, out of mind. This is much, much, much easier said than done for a lot of people, sure. But you can take efforts to limit how much time you have to spend in this person's general vicinity. Use it as an excuse to dive into a new passion, find a new hotspot to hang out in, or a new group of people to occasionally go out with.

For the betterment of your world, you have to keep going.This is where you do whatever you need to do. \"You\" comes first right now. Whatever will make you happy, do it (as long as it's not harmful, of course). So go paint the town red.

You deserve someone who sees you, sees your value, and wants to be an active part of your life. Those that don't can hit the road. Take a moment to concentrate on self-awareness. Look at yourself as objectively as possible. Was there something about the relationship that was safe because it was unreal?

Clearly this relationship didn't meet your needs, or you wouldn't feel the need to let them go. Know that. Let it sink in. This didn't meet your needs, but another one will.

You'll be waiting for an awfully, awfully long time. Generally speaking, the best way to predict future behavior is to look at past behavior. Since past behavior has led to heartbreak, why would future behavior be any different? That's right; it wouldn't.Chances are there's a part of you that knows all these things. That knows this relationship wasn't the best for you and that sees the logic in moving on (it's why you're here, after all.)

If this is controllable (they aren't a coworker, for example), do it. The process will go much, much faster. This does not give you an excuse to stay at home instead of going to class/the gym/out with friends. However, it does give you an excuse to alter your routine. Always go to the same cafe?

Wishing you did something differently, acted differently, said something differently is fruitless. You are who you are and if things didn't work out -- well, then something else was meant to.

If they want to talk to about it, tell them that. You both need some time apart from each other to see what it's like without the other. You need to step a bit back from the painting to see what the picture really is. If a few weeks pass and you find yourself wanting to see them and they feel similarly, take it slow.

What was it you liked about your other friend that put you two together? What do you need from them that they couldn't provide you? What are three things any friend of yours needs to be?\n",

But since it can't be changed, no use spending energy on it. Focus on what can change to make you happier. Your environment, for one, can change. Your outlook can change. Your needs can change.

            "Set each pot down on a separate burner. Turn the heat up to medium or medium-high, then wait for the water to come to a boil. This may take a few minutes.[5]Wait for both pots to come to a boil before moving on to the next step.\n",
            "Reduce the heat to low, then let both pots simmer for 1.5 to 2.5 hours.\n",
            "Again, you want this to happen simultaneously for both pots. Turn the knobs for both burners to low, then wait for the water to reduce to a simmer. Set the timer for anywhere between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.[6]The longer you let the water simmer, the brighter the color will be.\n",
            "Empty the water from the fabric pot.\n",
            "Use a wooden spoon, or something similar, to hold the fabric in place as you pour out the vinegar water. Don't worry if there is some liquid left in the pot.[7]Don't empty the water from the dye pot.\n",
            "Remove the beets from the dye pot.\n",
            "You can use a regular spoon to do this, but a slotted spoon would work even better. Discard the beets or save them for a recipe.[8]Save the red dye leftover from the beets. Don't dump this out.\n",
            "Pour the dye into the fabric pot, then stir the dye.\n",
            "Be sure to pour the dye slowly so that it doesn't splash. Next, stir the pot to ensure that everything is submerged; you may have to poke the folds of fabric to get them to stay down.[9]You won't be able to fill the fabric pot all the way. This is because some of the beet water evaporated while you cooked it.\n",
            "Soak the fabric off-heat in the dye for 12 to 24 hours.\n",
            "There is no need to soak it for longer than that. Make sure that the fabric is fully submerged, however, or it may not dye evenly. If you need to, weigh the fabric down with a plate, bowl, or jar.[10]Take the pot off the stove for this. Dont let the dye bath keep simmering for these 12 to 24 hours.\n",
            "Remove the fabric from the dye bath and squeeze it.\n",
            "Do not rinse the fabric, or you may lose some of that beautiful, vibrant color. Just pull the fabric out and gently squeeze the excess dye from it.[11]It might be a good idea to wear plastic gloves for this step. The beet water may stain your hands for a few days.[12]If you don't mind a lighter shade of pink, you can rinse the fabric in cool water.\n",
            "Dry the fabric in the hot sun or in a dryer.\n",
            "Heat is key to setting the dye into the fabric. If you live in a warm, sunny climate, drying the fabric outside work the best. Otherwise, toss the fabric into the dryer, and dry it on a low-heat setting.[13]If you are drying the fabric outside, keep a pot or bucket under it to catch any drips of dye.[14]\n",
            "Iron the fabric for 5 minutes to further set the dye.\n",
            "Adjust your iron to a no-steam, low-heat setting. Place the fabric on the ironing board, then iron it for about 5 minutes. Not only will this help further set the dye into the fabric, but it will also smooth out wrinkles.[15]Even though your fabric is made from cotton or linen, you should still use a low-heat or warm setting on your iron. Don't use the cotton or linen setting.There is a chance that some of the dye may transfer to the ironing board. Consider covering the board with an old, clean cloth first.\n",
            "Hand wash the fabric in cold water only when necessary.\n",
            "Even with the added vinegar, this is a natural dye. It is safer for the environment than regular dye, but it is not permanent. To help preserve the color, hand wash the fabric in cold water only when necessary; avoid using a washing machine, if possible.[16]If you choose to use a washing machine, use a cold water setting. Wash the dyed fabric separately to avoid color transfer.[17]\n",
            "How to Cleanse Crystals with Selenite: 5 Best Methods\n",
            "Activate your selenite with the intention of cleansing other crystals.\n",
            "First, make sure your selenite is cleansed and charged by laying it in natural light (30 minutes for sunlight, overnight for moonlight). Then, hold the stone and meditate on your connection to it to tune it to you. Once you feel connected, meditate on or speak out loud your intention to cleanse other stones with it.[1]Try to sum up your intention in just one sentence. If you find yourself rambling, it means your intention is not super focused or specific.Intentions or affirmations might be something like I cleanse you so that you may cleanse my other crystals or I will use you to heal my spirit.Cleansing your selenite first clears any leftover energy or influence from previous owners.\n",
            "Rest crystals with flat faces on a large piece of selenite for 24 hours.\n",
            "Selenite will draw negative energy out of other crystals when they come into physical contact. Simply lay your crystals on top of a large piece of selenite and let them rest. The selenite doesnt have to be a specific size, shape, or even be flatas long as its bigger than the crystals its cleansing, itll work.[2]Selenite slabs or charging plates have large, flat surfaces so you can rest other crystals on top of them easily.[3]This works best for faceted crystals that won't roll off of the slab and potentially break.Do this ritual indoors. Too much exposure to sunlight or any exposure to water or rain will damage your selenite.\n",
            "Place fragile, small, or rounded crystals and jewelry in a selenite bowl.\n",
            "Selenite bowls make beautiful decorations as well as potent crystal cleaners. Simply put any gems or jewelry you want to cleanse in the bowl and let them rest for a few hours. Your crystals enjoy the healing energy of selenite, so you can even use the bowl as permanent storage for them.[4]A bowl ensures rounded crystals and gems wont roll away like they might on a slab or charging plate.Alternatively, wrap jewelry like bracelets and necklaces around selenite sticks or wands, or place your jewelry on top of any piece of selenite you have.[5]\n",
            "Use a selenite tower to cleanse many crystals at once.\n",
            "First, move your tower to a space where you wont mind having a bunch of crystals laying around for a while. Arrange your crystals in a circle around the tower, preferably so theyre touching it. Let the tower and crystals sit in this formation for about 24 hours, or until you sense that the room is clear of negative energy.[6]The selenite tower can still cleanse the crystals if they arent touching, but physical contact makes the process faster and more thorough.\n",
            "Charge selenite with sunlight to give your other crystals a charge, too.\n",
            "Sunlight has powerful charging energy that can be transferred between crystals. First, charge your selenite by letting it absorb natural sunlight for about 30 minutes. Then bring it inside and place your other crystals on top of it. The selenite will share its solar charge with the others in addition to cleansing them.[7]\n",
            "Lay selenite in sunlight for 30 minutes for a quick cleanse and charge.\n",
            "Sunlight blasts away stagnant energy and charges crystals with vibrant potential. Lay your selenite bowl, slab, tower, or jewelry on a windowsill or safe spot outdoors to absorb some direct sunlight. Bring it in after about 30 minutes to 1 hour since too much sun can cause the crystal to fade.[8]Make sure your selenite is in a spot where it wont easily roll away or get knocked over while its charging.It doesn't have to be an especially sunny day to work. Any exposure to natural light is cleansing and refreshing.Cleanse your selenite when you feel its protective and healing energy weakening, its absorbed a lot of bad energy at once, or it's your first time using a particular piece of selenite.\n",
            "Let selenite absorb moonlight overnight for a gentle cleanse and charge.\n",
            "Moonlight is a pure, cleansing force thats safe to use on any crystal. Simply rest your selenite in a safe place on a windowsill, patio, or porch that gets lots of moonlight and leave it overnight. In the morning, it will be refreshed and ready to heal at max capacity.[9]The moons cleansing power will be even stronger during a Full Moon.Try leaving your selenite out during dawn or dusk so it can absorb the energies of the sun and moon at the same time.Charging selenite with moonlight is usually considered a less potent and slower way to charge crystals than with sunlight.\n",
            "Smudge selenite in sage smoke to absorb healing energy.\n",
            "Sage has been used as a spiritual cleanser for thousands of years. To cleanse with sage, burn one end of a sage stick until it starts smoking, then place it in a ceramic or heat-safe bowl. Grab your selenite and move it through the smoke, or use a feather to waft the smoke around for a few minutes. Imagine all of the stones negative energy floating away and dissipating with the smoke.Perform this ritual outdoors if possible. If youre doing it inside, open up some doors or windows to clear out the smoke.Cleanse with incense, Palo Santo, or any herb that you feel a special connection with in place of sage if you dont have any.\n",
            "Bathe large selenite pieces or towers in sound waves for 10 minutes.\n",
            "A drone or chant generates waves that help remove vibrational impurities from your selenite. Sit right near your crystal and make a constant tone with a singing bowl, tuning fork, or bell (you can even sing or chant if you dont have any of these). Visualize sound waves washing over the selenite and carrying away bad energy.[10]The exact pitch you make doesnt matter as long as you have a clear, cleansing intention.Sound waves are great for cleansing large stones that are hard to move or a big collection of many smaller stones all at once.\n",
            "Bury selenite in dry Himalayan or sea salt to absorb bad energy.\n",
            "First, place your selenite and salt in a container or bowl, making sure the selenite is completely covered. Then, move the container outside where it can sit in natural light and let it rest for 24 hours (or until you sense that its been cleansed). Afterward, gently brush or rub the selenite with your fingers or a soft cloth. Do not rinse it with water, since it will make the selenite dissolve.Try adding cleansing herbs like sage, cedar, or sandalwood to your salt for an extra boost.\n",
            "Cover selenite in uncooked brown rice to harmonize unbalanced energy.\n",
            "Brown rice is a safe and easy way to draw negative energy out of a crystal. Fill a bowl or container with rice and your selenite, and make sure the stone is covered completely. Let the bowl sit for up to 24 hours, or until your intuition tells you that the selenite has been refreshed.[11]Throw out the rice afterwards. Its full of bad vibes, so you definitely dont want to cook or eat it!\n",
            "Selenite can also purify your home and soothe your mind.\n",
            "As a self-cleansing crystal that works nonstop, its a common household stone. Its high vibrations bring good luck and protection to your home, plus it purifies and cleanses the air in whichever room you place it. Its also said to bring peace and tranquility to anybody inside its field of energy.[12]Place your selenite in a room that will benefit from its healing powers, like your living room or bedroom.Cleanse and charge your selenite so it can continue healing your home, spirit, and crystals to the best of its ability.\n",
            "Selenite has incredible healing properties for your body and spirit.\n",
            "When you wear selenite, impurities (free radicals that damage cells and cause disease) are blocked from entering your body. Common reported physical benefits include better spine alignment, metabolism, and circulation, as well as improved eyesight and stable blood pressure.[13]Spiritually, selenite is said to fend off hostile or destructive spirits. Its said to heal and soothe the spirits of anyone who wears it, and can be used to heal others too.\n",
            "Selenite sharpens your intuition and keeps you emotionally unburdened.\n",
            "Selenite is known to balance the Crown Chakra, the violet or white pool of spiritual energy at the top of your head. Sleep with selenite under your pillow to open this chakra, unlock dreams, and find guidance from helpful spirits (and your own instincts).[14]Highly empathetic people can use selenites clearing energy field to stop picking up other peoples emotions as well. Carry or wear a piece during your day to stay light and upbeat.\n",

            "The Liturgy of the Hours is the daily prayer of the Catholic Church.\n",
            "By praying throughout the day at set intervals, the Liturgy of the Hours is a way for Christians to follow St. Pauls exhortation to pray without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:17). The Liturgy of the Hours is also called the Divine Office.[1]\n",
            "There are 7 hours in the Liturgy of the Hours, or times to pray.\n",
            "These hours are broken up into the 3 major hours, and the 4 minor ones. The goal of the Liturgy of the Hours is to unite everyone in the Catholic Churchall clergy are committed to praying the major hours, and are encouraged to pray 1 or 2 minor hours as well.[2]Even though the Liturgy of the Hours is required for clergy and others living a consecrated life, laypeople can also benefit a lot from the practice.[3]\n",
            "Set aside 3 times a day to pray.\n",
            "Although the timing for each of the hours in the divine office is not strict, it can help you form a routine to pray at the same time each day. Keep in mind that the major hours may take you longer to pray than the minor hoursset aside 15-20 minutes for each hour. Although you can adjust this schedule as you need, the general timing for each of the major hours is as follows:The Office of Readings: Can be prayed at any time of day, but normally prayed immediately before the Office of Morning Prayer. You may also choose to do this prayer at night, before you sleep.[4]The Office of Morning Prayer: Also known as Lauds, it is generally prayed at around daybreak, or 6 a.m. If waking up early is difficult for you, you can also pray this office the night before.The Office of Evening Prayer: Also referred to as Vespers, it is normally prayed at sunset, or around 6 p.m.\n",
            "Obtain a physical or digital breviary.\n",
            "Your breviary is a collection of prayers that you use whenever you need to pray the Liturgy of the Hours. There are two options for a physical breviary: the single-volume Christian Prayer and the four-volume Liturgy of the Hours.[5]If youre using a physical breviary, its important to have a guidebook to help you find the proper prayers for the day. Your church may have a guidebook for you to follow, or you can pick up a copy of the Saint Joseph Guide for the Liturgy of the Hours.If youd prefer the convenience of a digital breviary, consider downloading a smartphone app or visiting a website like iBreviary.\n",

            "Try carb supplements.\n",
            "Although it's best to snack on fruits, veggies, and whole grains to get carbs, you can also add carbohydrate supplements to a shake before, during, or after your workout. These high glycemic carbs  dextrose, glucose, and maltodextrin  require little digestion and give you a quick blood sugar spike. This helps your body absorb protein and repair muscle better. Waxy maize is another complex carb supplement that helps your body refuel by replenishing its sugar stores (called glycogen).\n",

In fact, a strictly original coin is often worth more than a cleaned (tampered with) version of the same coin. To retain the value of your coin, treat it as a museum piece and properly curate it only when the coin is likely to further degrade because of surface contaminants.[4]If you do want to have a coin cleaned, talk to a preservation specialist. Some coins are indeed worth more when contaminants are properly removed.\n",

Dont expect to fetch mint state prices if your coin is worn or has detractions.[5]Coins that were never circulated are known as mint state or uncirculated coins. These fetch higher prices and should have minimal wear and be \"as struck\".Coins are graded on a numerical scale from MS-70 (Mint State 70 perfect condition) all the way down to AG-3 (About Good poor, highly worn) and FR-2 (Fair features barely discernible).There are also \"details grades\" given to coins that have been compromised. Such coins are given a details grade and a reason for issuing the details grade such as F-15 details  environmental damage.

            "Use rosin-based flux for electrical soldering.\n",
            "If you need to remove oxidization from wires, a rosin-based solder is your best bet. As most electronics use more fragile, thinner wires, anything too corrosive may risk damaging them and shorting your circuit. Find a rosin-based solder at your local hardware store when working with electronics.[1]Rosin-based flux consists of a distillation product from pine tree sap, dissolved in a suitable organic solvent.[2]This kind of flux is solid at room temperature. Heating with soldering iron causes rosin flux to liquefy and become slightly chemically active.Many kinds of solder wire used for soldering in electronics come with their core already filled with rosin flux.\n",
            "Go for an acid flux when soldering pipes.\n",
            "If you're working with something bigger than electrical wiring, such as copper piping, you'll need something more corrosive. Acid flux or tinning flux will remove larger areas of oxidization and give you a much stronger soldering job.[3]Tinning flux has small amounts of a powdered metal alloy mixed into the paste. The powder will melt with the flux and help fill the inside of the pipe you are soldering, making it more waterproof and longer-lasting.\n",
            "Opt for leaded solder when working with electronics.\n",
            "Leaded solder will melt at a lower temperature than other types, which makes it better for delicate electrical wiring. Ask at your local hardware or electronics store for leaded or electrical solder and you should have a small variety of types to choose from.[4] Here are a few key differences in types of solder that may come up:Lead-free electrical solder will also work for small wiring projects. It is more environmentally-friendly as it doesn't contain lead, but also will not hold quite as strong.[5]Some leaded solders will come with a rosin core. This means that they are slightly hollow and will have a thin line of rosin flux running through the middle. It will only be a small amount, so it shouldn't replace other flux, but it will increase the flux coating of your wires.[6]Leaded solders that are solid all the way through and don't have a rosin core are also a solid choice. These may oxidize slightly more, but as long as you are using soldering flux they should still hold strongly for a long time.If you are using leaded solder, make sure to wash your hands once you have finished working with it as the lead is toxic.\n",
            "Choose silvered solder for soldering pipes together.\n",
            "Silver has a much higher melting point than lead, so it works much better for larger soldering projects. Ask for pipe or silvered solder at your local hardware store when working with pipes. You should never use lead-based solder when working with piping that will carry water, as the lead is toxic and will make the water unsafe to drink.While lead-free solder may work when soldering pipes, it won't be as strong or as durable as silvered solder.\n",
            "Turn on your soldering iron and clean it when working with electronics.\n",
            "Plug in or turn on your soldering iron to start heating it up. Once it is hot, use a damp sponge to clean away any solder left on the tip of the iron, making sure to never touch the hot end of the iron while it is on.[7]Always keep your soldering iron in a stand while it is on. The tip will get very hot, so it shouldn't be allowed to rest on any surfaces as this may start a fire. Don't leave your soldering iron unattended while you are using it.Apply a small amount of solder to the end of your soldering iron once it has heated up and been cleaned. Once the tip is covered and has a shiny appearance, you can wipe away any excess on the same damp sponge. This is called \"tinning\" your iron and will stop it from oxidizing as you work with it.\n",
            "Go for a blowtorch when soldering pipes.\n",
            "As pipes are much bigger and more solid than intricate wiring, a soldering iron may take a long time to heat a pipe up to the right temperature. Use a propane torch or something similar when soldering with pipes. For the best results, adjust the torch until you have a blue flame around 2 inches (5.1cm) long, and hold the tip of the flame to the pipes.[8]Make sure you always light your blowtorch away from yourself and use proper safety precautions when working with it. Wear protective, tinted glasses, fire-proof leather gloves and flame-retardant clothing for extra safety.Getting the perfect temperature with a blowtorch may take more practice than when working with a soldering iron. If the flux you are working with begins smoldering and turns black, it's a sign you are using too much heat. If the solder doesn't melt when touched to pipes, you might not be using enough. Keep practicing until you get a sense of the right way to work.\n",
            "Twist the exposed ends of your wires together.\n",
            "Overlap your two wires to make a small cross symbol and begin twisting each together over and around the other wire. Keep wrapping the wires together until the ends of each wire are pushed down into the other wire. There should be no pointed ends, but a clear, intertwining pattern along your wires.[9]If you want to apply heat-shrink tubing over your soldering, you should do so before twisting the wires together. Make sure the tubing is as small as you can get it, to ensure it shrinks tightly to the wires.[10]You can also mesh the two wires together to hold them together. Unravel and spread apart the individual strands of each end of wire before pushing them together. Twist the wires together to keep them connected.You should only need to expose around 1 inch (2.5cm) of each wire to wrap them together.You should be twisting the two wires around each other, so that the wires cross and intertwine near the middle of the joint. This is about holding the wires together more than it is intricately connecting them.\n",
            "Coat the wires with the soldering flux.\n",
            "Use a small paintbrush or your fingers to scoop up a small amount of soldering flux. Spread the flux over the area you will be soldering, making sure to cover the wires fully. Wipe any excess flux off your fingers or brush before soldering.[11]Soldering flux is only corrosive once it is heated up and in its liquid form. As long as it is still a paste when you start working with it, you don't need to worry about getting any on your skin.You should coat the portion of the wire that has been twisted together, as this is the area that needs soldering. You don't need to solder any point closer to the wire insulation where the wires don't overlap.It may help to get something that can hold the wires off of your work surface as you solder them together. A \"helping hands\" wire holder or another similar clamp will work perfectly and should be available from your local hardware store.\n",
            "Press the soldering gun onto one side of the wires to melt the flux.\n",
            "Once the soldering iron is hot, press it against one section of the wires to start heating it up. The flux should very quickly melt and turn into a liquid that will run into the wiring. Keep holding the iron to the wires until the flux has melted, just before it starts bubbling.[12]To speed up the heat transfer between the iron and the wires, press a tiny amount of solder onto the tip of the iron just as you press it to the wire.\n",
            "Feed the solder into the wires to hold them together.\n",
            "With the iron still pressed against the wires to keep them hot, press the tip of your solder onto the opposite side of the wires. If the wiring is hot enough, the solder should melt immediately as you press it to the wires and cover the connection entirely. Make sure all of the wires are coated in solder before removing the iron.[13]You only need a very small amount of solder to keep the wires connected. Press the tip of your solder onto the wires for a second or two at first, adding more solder if you need it.It may help to grip the solder wire around 5 inches (13cm) from the tip of the wire that is being soldered, so as to distance your hands from the hot solder. For extra safety, wear heat-resistant leather gloves while working.\n",
            "Let the solder cool and harden.\n",
            "Take the soldering iron away from the wires to let them begin cooling. As they do, the solder should very quickly solidify over the course of a few seconds. Once the solder has set, you should see no exposed wiring, and the two wires should be very strongly connected together.[14]If you are covering your soldering with heat-shrink tubing, feed it over the connection at this point. Use a heat gun to begin shrinking the tubing, starting at the middle and working to each edge to prevent air from getting trapped inside.[15]\n",
            "Clean the area that you'll be soldering.\n",
            "Use sandpaper, steel wool, or anything else abrasive to clean away any grime or dirt from any areas of your pipes and fittings that need to be soldered. This will let your solder hold more tightly to the pipe and result in a more sturdy connection.[16]You should only need to clean around 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) of the piping to give you room to solder easily. If you're using a larger pipe fitting, you may need to clean more to ensure the point of overlap between the pipe and the fitting is prepared for soldering.Use 120-grit sandpaper or grade 1 steel wool for cleaning your pipe fittings. This should be enough to strip away dirt and grime without damaging the pipes themselves.[17]If you plan on cutting and soldering a lot of pipes, you might benefit from a specialised pipe cleaner. This will let you more easily scrub away any impurities on the inside and outside of your pipes. Ask at your local hardware store or look online to find one that suits your needs.\n",
            "Apply flux to the outside to your pipes.\n",
            "Use a small paintbrush to cover the ends of your pipes and the insides of your pipe fittings with a thin layer of flux. Look around the edges of the pipe for any large lumps of flux and brush them away.[18]Any type of flux that you have will work when soldering pipes together. Acid flux will be more corrosive, but may damage pipes that are too fragile. Tinning flux will help hold your pipes together more strongly, but may be more difficult to find or more expensive. If you're unsure, ask at your local hardware store for advice on the best type of flux to use for the job you're working on.\n",
            "Connect the pipes and fittings together.\n",
            "Hold the two sections you need to connect together in each hand, keeping them off of your work surface to prevent any flux from rubbing off. Push the two ends together securely until they are fully connected. Wipe away any flux that comes off with a clean paintbrush.[19]You should connect a section of a few pipes together before you begin to solder them. Working one at a time may be very slow, and trying to deal with a long section all at once may be very difficult! Work with a few pieces at a time.\n",
            "Heat the fitting or female connector up with a soldering iron or blowtorch.\n",
            "Heat will make the metal expand, so you should always heat the larger sections of your pipes up before the smaller sections. Hold a soldering iron to the pipe, or use a blowtorch to heat the metal up until the soldering flux melts into the joint and begins to bubble slightly.\n",
            "Press the solder to the opposite side of the pipe.\n",
            "When the flux is just starting to bubble and the pipe is hot, press the tip of the solder to the opposite side as you are holding the blowtorch. The solder should melt immediately and work into the joint to hold it together. Pull the torch away and quickly run the solder around the circumference of the joint to completely seal it.[20]You should only need to use around  inch (1.9cm) of the solder to completely seal the pipe.If the solder doesn't run into the joint and forms small beads that roll away from it instead, you might have burnt the flux or may not have cleaned the pipe properly. The pipe may have also been heated too much or too little, which will also cause the solder to bead off. Wait until the pipes are cooled, disconnect them and start again.It's easier to reach around the back side of the pipe if you bend a small hook in the solder wire before you begin soldering.Grip the solder far enough away from the tip that you won't risk melted solder getting on your hands. For extra safety, wear fire-resistant gloves as you work.\n",
            "Examine the joints to make sure they are completely soldered.\n",
            "Once the pipes have cooled a little, look around the edges of the joints to make sure they are evenly coated with solder. If you notice any sections without solder, apply a small amount of flux on the area and let it melt with the residual heat of the pipes. Use the blowtorch to heat the pipe up again and apply a small amount of solder to the bare area.[21]It may take a while to get a good feel for when pipes are completely soldered. As a general rule of thumb, as long as there is a thin, silvery trim around the edges of your fittings, the pipe should be fully soldered.\n",

            "Know if you are at risk.\n",
            "Those who have previously had miscarriages in the second trimester (between weeks 14 and 27) are the most likely to have a cervical insufficiency, so it is important to disclose any prior pregnancy complications or miscarriages to your doctor. People are not diagnosed with an incompetent cervix until they have suffered one or more late miscarriages. Knowing about this condition in advance will allow your doctor to monitor your condition more closely from the beginning. This can result in earlier detection of a weak cervix, which leads to an increased chance of prolonging the delivery. Any surgery on the cervix also puts you at risk, including a D&C, cervical cone, or LEEP.[2]\n",
            "Be attentive to possible symptoms.\n",
            "Although it is possible for an incompetent cervix to be present without any outward symptoms, in some cases there may be warning signs. These would typically occur between 14 and 22 weeks of pregnancy and include backache, discharge or warm liquid felt within the vagina, and pelvic pressure.[3]\n",
            "Contact your OB/GYN immediately if you notice any of these symptoms.\n",
            "Although they may be completely unrelated to an incompetent cervix, it is always best to err on the side of caution and let the doctor do a complete exam to rule it out. This might include an ultrasound. Keep in mind that diagnoses of cervical insufficiency are based on one's past medical history of miscarriage during the second trimester. If you do have a cervical insufficiency, you have some medical options.[4]\n",
            "Discuss treatment options with your doctor.\n",
            "He or she will be able to lay out the possible optionscerclage, a pessary, and bed restand tell you which ones would best for you. Keep in mind that a cerclage (suturing the cervix closed) is by far the most common treatment, and allows many people with previous histories of miscarriage to successfully carry a baby to term. A pessary, similar to the outer ring of a diaphragm, changes the angle of the cervix and reinforces it.[5]\n",
            "Consider with your doctor whether serial ultrasounds might be a good first step.\n",
            "With ultrasounds every two weeks during the second trimester of your pregnancy, the doctor can monitor the risk of an incompetent cervix. If he or she sees warning signs, then you can have a cerclage.[6]\n",
            "Undergo a minimal surgery to get a cerclage.\n",
            "Once you are diagnosed with incompetent cervix, your doctor will likely suggest a cerclage. A cerclage is a procedure in which a stitch is placed around the cervix and tightened to keep the cervix closed. There are five types of cerclage that can be performed, and your doctor will determine which type is best for your situation depending upon how far along you are in your pregnancy. A cerclage is usually removed near the end of pregnancy to permit normal delivery.Occasionally, depending on conditions that are present during the pregnancy, the cerclage will be left in place and the mother will undergo a cesarean section to deliver the baby.[7]\n",
            "Speak with your doctor about having a pessary put in place.\n",
            "A pessary is an apparatus that is positioned within the vagina to help raise up and reinforce the cervix.  This may be used instead of, or in conjunction with a cerclage.[8]\n",
            "Ask whether bed rest or pelvic rest might help.\n",
            "Bed rest may be prescribed by your doctor for an incompetent cervix. Bed rest restrictions can vary from simply avoiding any heavy lifting or housework, to total bed rest where you must remain in a reclining position at all times, including for bathing and going to the bathroom.[9] Talk to your doctor about whether or not some type of bed rest might be a good option for you. You may also need to abstain from sex during a period of bed and pelvic rest.\n",
            "Ensure you are getting adequate rest.\n",
            "Even if you are not prescribed bed rest, ensuring that you get adequate rest is important. Make sure that you get plenty of sleep and avoid overexerting yourself.\n",
            "Ask your doctor about vigorous exercise.\n",
            "He or she might suggest you refrain from high-intensity workouts and from having sex. Because your cervix is weak, exercise can further exacerbate your condition.[10]\n",
            "Do your kegels.\n",
            "Kegel exercises strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. To ensure that you are doing them correctly, while you are urinating clench your muscles to stop the flow of urine, and then release to continue the flow; that is what exercising your kegels feels like. While is it not certain that kegels will prevent an incompetent cervix, they do have certain benefits including enhanced sexual pleasure, aiding in vaginal birth, help for incontinence and a quicker postpartum recovery.\n",

            "Download a table of Amharic characters.\n",
            "The Amharic script is partially an alphabet, and partially syllabic. While there are vowel and consonant characters, each character usually represents a syllable, rather than an individual letter. The script includes 33 basic shapes.[2]There are numerous tables of Amharic characters available online that you can use to practice the characters. The US Library of Congress has a complete table with pronunciation of each syllabic character available at https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/amharic.pdf.You can also use a website such as http://amharicteacher.com/hahu/, which provides the shape of the character as well as its pronunciation, if you click on the character.\n",
            "Get blank ruled paper to practice your script.\n",
            "Special lines aren't needed to write Amharic script. However, you might find it easier to use wide-ruled paper initially, so that you can write the characters a little larger.To learn how to write Amharic, practice each of the characters repeatedly until your writing becomes automatic. As you progress, remember to go back and review the characters you've already learned periodically.\n",
            "Keep characters roughly the same size.\n",
            "If you are familiar with the Latin alphabet, you know that there are several letters that extend above or below the other letters. In fidl, all of the letters are written within two imaginary lines, with no parts extending above or below those lines.Some of the characters float between the lines, touching neither the top or bottom. Others extend to the top and bottom lines. Looking at the characters on the chart will help you determine where they should be placed within the lines.\n",
            "Use downward strokes to form characters.\n",
            "While there are no specifically required strokes for fidl, as with some other scripts, all downward strokes are generally used. This means that parts of a character that look like a loop often are made with 2 strokes rather than just one.For example, the first character you'll likely learn to form is the ha character: . Start at the top, make a downward stroke, then make the second downward stroke curving around to connect to the first. This method is preferred to simply using a single, curving stroke, as you would if you were writing the English letter U.Practicing with downward strokes will help you to write more quickly. Break down each character into pieces that can be formed using downward strokes.\n",
            "Start with the simplest \"first order\" characters.\n",
            "Fidl is organized into 7 orders. The first order characters are the simplest, and form the basis of all other orders. Once you learn the first order, you can form the characters in the other orders by modifying the original first order character.[3]There are 33 characters in the first order. Break them up into smaller groups of 5 to 10 characters for practice. Each day, repeat the first characters you've learned so that you gradually build your knowledge of fidl characters.\n",
            "Advance through the other 6 orders of characters.\n",
            "Most of the characters in the other orders are formed by making a particular modification to the basic character in the first order. Recognizing these patterns will make it easier to memorize the different characters.[4]For example, you form characters in the second order by adding a hooked dash to the center of the right side of the first order character. Thus,  (ha) becomes  (hu).As you progress through the characters, you'll note that some syllables are represented by 2 or 3 different characters. These characters are relatively interchangeable in Amharic. While there may be a specific spelling that is more commonly used, alternative spellings would be understood.Set aside 10-15 minutes each day to practice forming characters. At the beginning of your practice session, write each of the first order characters. Then proceed to the order you're currently working on, and repeat the characters several times.\n",
            "Start with personal pronouns.\n",
            "Many sentences you write will include personal pronouns. Pronouns also determine how you conjugate the verbs you use. Personal pronouns in Amharic are simple words with only 2 or 3 characters, so they are relatively easy to learn.[5]The first-person singular pronoun in Amharic is  (pronounced eh-neh). For third-person singular, use  (pronounced eh-soo) for he and  (pronounced eh-swah) for she.The second-person pronoun,  (pronounced ehnteh), can be either singular or plural.For plural pronouns, use  (pronounced ehnyuh) for we and  (pronounced eh-neh-soo) for they.\n",
            "Learn Amharic words for furniture and parts of your home.\n",
            "These are words that are likely to come up frequently when you converse or write in Amharic. If you write the word on a card or sticky note and label the items around your home, you'll learn to recognize the words more easily.[6]For example, the Amharic word for sofa is . It is a loan word from English, and is pronounced the same way in Amharic as it is in English.The Amharic word for house is  (pronounced beht). This word is also used to mean \"room' in Amharic. So, for example, bedroom is   (pronounced metabet), and livingroom is   (pronounced menoryabet).You can find a list of Amharic words for common items around the house at http://amharicteacher.com/home/.\n",

The same website also has lists for items of clothing, fruits and vegetables, and other categories.\n",
            "Add Amharic words for animals to your vocabulary.\n",
            "Many words for animals use only 2 or 3 characters, which make them some of the simplest words to write in Amharic. You can copy the words from an Amharic website, or listen to the words and try to sound out the spelling for yourself.[7]There is a list of Amharic animal words with pictures of the animals and sound files for each word available at http://amharicteacher.com/animals/.Some Amharic words for animals sound similar to the English name for that animal. For example, the Amharic word for camel is  (pronounced geh-mehl).\n",
            "Use subject-object-verb word order.\n",
            "In Amharic sentences, the verb is always the last word. Typically, the subject begins the sentence, followed by the object and any prepositional phrases. Adjectives may come before or after the subject.In colloquial or common spoken usage, you may also encounter object-subject-verb word order. However, the object always comes before the verb.Personal pronouns typically are dropped from the sentence. The subject is assumed from the conjugation of the verb.\n",
            "Place a \"\" between words to indicate word separation.\n",
            "Amharic fidl does not use spaces the way languages written in Latin-based scripts do. Instead, the  symbol between characters indicates that one word has ended. The next word begins immediately after the symbol.[8]When typing in Amharic, many writers simply place spaces between the words rather than using \"\" as a word separation symbol.\n",
            "Add other punctuation as necessary for full sentences.\n",
            "Amharic also has its own punctuation that is used when writing in script. Amharic readers and speakers will also understand some English punctuation marks, such as the exclamation point (!) or question mark (?).[9]The symbol \"\" is used to indicate a period or full stop at the end of a sentence.The symbol \"\" is used to indicate a question mark, although an English-style question mark may also be used.The symbol \"\" is used for a comma, while \"\" is a semi-colon and \"\" is a colon. These punctuation marks are all composed of 2 dots, like an English colon. The difference depends on where the straight line is placed (or 2 lines, in the case of a semi-colon).\n",
            "Become pen pals with a native speaker.\n",
            "One of the easiest ways to improve your Amharic writing and speaking skills is to communicate regularly with a native speaker. Websites such as My Language Exchange can help connect you with an Ethiopian whose native language is Amharic.[10]If you live near a university, find out if the university teaches Amharic or has an Amharic interest club. There will probably also be Amharic native speakers in Ethiopian student groups.If there's an Ethiopian restaurant near you, ask the owners if they know anyone who would like to write to you so you can practice your Amharic.\n",
            "Enable or download Ethiopic fonts.\n",
            "If you want to type in Amharic script on your computer, you'll need the correct font. You may also want to print a keyboard guide until you've memorized which keys produce which Amharic characters.[11]Many computers come with Ethiopic fonts pre-installed. However, for older computers you may have to download fonts or extensions to read or type in Amharic.

            "Have your chimney inspected once a year to make sure its safe to use.\n",
            "Hire a professional fireplace inspector (also sometimes called a chimney sweep) to do an inspection every year before you make your first firefireplaces that arent maintained properly can pose a huge safety risk. The inspector will do a basic sweep, check the flue, and make sure the fireplace is up to safety standards.[1]A general inspection costs about $125 to $250.\n",
            "Pick a hard, seasoned wood to cook your meals with.\n",
            "Cedar, alder, maple, hickory, pecan, oak, cherry, and apple wood are all great choices for your indoor fireplace. The smoke from these woods will infuse your food with a great flavor, and they will easily get hot enough and make big enough flames for you to cook your meal.[2]\n",
            "Learn how to safely build a fire in your fireplace.\n",
            "Check that the chimney is clean and unblocked, and make sure to open the damper. Stack a few larger logs on the bottom, add a few smaller logs on top of those, and then top off the stack with some kindling. This way, the smoke from the kindling will have easy access to the chimney and your house wont get as smokey.Putting the bigger logs on the bottom will also give you a longer burn time, from 3 to 5 hours, which can be really helpful if youre cooking stews or other dishes that need more time.There are lots of different methods to start a fire. Some people recommend putting kindling on the bottom and some say you should start with a 1 to 2in (2.5 to 5.1cm) bed of ash. Kindling on the bottom will make a fire with a shorter burn time, and using a thicker bed of ash will produce a longer-lasting heat for roasting.\n",
            "Use the right kind of cookware and utensils to keep you safe.\n",
            "Long tongs, fire-resistant gloves, skewers, a cast-iron skillet, a meat thermometer, and a Dutch oven are some of the basic tools youll need to cook safely in your fireplace. Additionally, set a cooling rack inside of a rimmed baking sheet and keep this next to the fireplace. You can use this to set your hot dishes on so that they dont accidentally burn the floor.[3]You can also use a few bricks to prop a grill pan or cast-iron skillet above the flames. This can give your food a more even cook and reduce the risk that itll burn. Try to arrange the bricks and grill pan so that they are about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13cm) above the wood or kindling.Avoid using anything made of plastic, silicone, or glass. You can use aluminum or stainless steel, just be aware that the bottoms will probably permanently turn black.\n",
            "Clean up the fireplace after each meal so it stays in prime condition.\n",
            "Once the fire has gone out, shovel up the ashes and dispose of them in a garbage bag. You can then sweep out the ashes that remain, or use a vacuum to clean up. Dont forget to wipe off the hearth, as the ash from the fire probably got on the hearth, too.[4]In addition to cleaning the fireplace after each meal, you should also deep clean your fireplace every 2 to 3 months while its in use.\n",
            "Grill meats and vegetables in the fireplace for a nice, smoky flavor.\n",
            "You can buy a grill insert made specifically for fireplace grilling, or you can build a makeshift one yourself out of bricks and a grill pan. Set the food directly on the grill pan, or use a cast-iron skillet on top of the pan to help contain the drippings. Hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, asparagus, shrimp, corn on the cob, and tons of other foods are great options to throw on your indoor fireplace grill.Check the temperature of meats often to ensure theyre cooked through. A hotdog will cook through more quickly, in just 3 to 4 minutes, whereas chicken will take closer to 10 to 12 minutes. Use an instant-read digital thermometer to make sure things are cooked through. Chicken should be cooked to 165F (74C), hamburger should be cooked to 160F (71C), pork should be cooked to 150 to 160F (66 to 71C), and steak should be cooked to 135 to 155F (57 to 68C), depending on how well-done you want it.Veggies will be done once they are easily pierced with a fork or knife, which most often takes about 5 to 10 minutes. They should have a light char on the outside.\n",
            "Make foil-packet meals for easy prep and clean-up.\n",
            "Use heavy-duty foil so there is less of a chance of the packet ripping. Put any meat in the center of the piece of foil and then add the veggies on top of the meat. Fold over the sides and roll the edges together to seal in the food. Set the filled and sealed foil packet on a grill pan that is elevated above the fire. Let them cook for 35 to 45 minutes, occasionally flipping the packets over.Chicken, sausages, or shrimp and a mix of vegetables, like carrots, potatoes, onions, and peppers, make awesome meals! Drizzle a little bit of olive oil over the veggies and add some salt and pepper for a really simple preparation, or be a little more adventurous and look up some cool recipes to try out.\n",
            "Skewer hotdogs, marshmallows, and other camping favorites.\n",
            "This is perhaps one of the easiest ways to cook over a fireplace, indoors or outside. Use long, metal skewers so that you wont have to get too close to the fire. Put your favorite food onto the skewer, and then roast it over the open flames. When the food is done, use tongs to remove the hot item so you dont burn yourself.In addition to the classic hotdogs and marshmallows, you can also cook heartier veggies, like bell peppers, shrimp, bacon, and fruits, like plums or apples!When cooking food on a skewer, check the item every 2 to 3 minutes, or whenever you notice that its starting to char on the outside.If you dont fancy the idea of holding your skewer over the flame, prepare a few kebobs on skewers and set them on a grill pan in the fireplace.\n",
            "Use a dutch oven to make stews in the wintertime.\n",
            "Prepare the dish and put it into the Dutch oven while the fire is heating up. Use a fireplace crane or set the Dutch oven on top of a grill pan that is suspended above the flames by some bricks. Check the food every 20 to 30 minutes to see how its coming alongit should cook faster in the fireplace than it would on the stovetop or in an oven.Always use fire-resistant gloves and long-handled tongs when youre checking the dish. Never touch the Dutch oven with bare hands.If you plan on cooking in your fireplace often, it may be worthwhile to invest in a Dutch oven with legs. This way, you can just set the Dutch oven into the fireplace without worrying about setting up the grill pan and bricks.\n",
            "Put vegetables directly onto the logs to give them a good char.\n",
            "Onions, eggplant, bell peppers, potatoes, beets, and yams are great vegetables to cook this way. Dont set them directly on a flame, but rather put them on top of a log that hasnt fully started to burn yet. The fire from the logs below will help provide the heat to cook the veggies through. Keep an eye on the vegetables and remove them from the fireplace when they start to look soft.[5]Potatoes, yams, and carrots will take the longest to cook, about 30 to 40 minutes. Onions and squashes take about 15 to 20 minutes, and softer vegetables, like peppers, eggplant, and mushrooms, will take about 10 minutes to cook.\n",

            "Find a quadcopter design in a book or online for reference.\n",
            "There are many websites and books devoted specifically to building your own drone. The most common kind of home-built drone tends to start with an X shape that allows you to mount 4 rotors (called a quadcopter). This design is easy to build and is used even on high-end drones. Having a design to follow will help make it easier to decide where best to place each component.Once you've finished a quadcopter drone, you can try larger designs that incorporate more motors to carry more equipment like cameras.Many drone designs are available for free online if you search DIY drone design.\n",
            "Make a frame for the drone out of metal, plastic, or wood.\n",
            "Begin constructing your frame using the material of your choice. Model plastic, balsa wood, or thin metal (thinner than .25 inches (0.64cm)) are best. For a simple quadcopter design, lay one 12in (30cm) long piece of wood, plastic or light metal across another, so it creates an X shape with 90-degree angles. Each extending arm of the drone frame should reach toward what would be the corner of a perfect square you could draw around the frame. Choose a frame material that is at least 1 inch (2.5cm) wide to support mounting your engines.[1]You can purchase model plastic, thin metal, or balsa wood at most hobby or model stores. You can also find these materials at drone retailers or on websites like Amazon.Use glue or duct tape to secure the two pieces of your frame together.Don't move on to the next step until the pieces of the frame are secure and any glue you've used has dried.\n",
            "Purchase motors, propellers and other electronics from a drone retailer.\n",
            "There are some components of your drone that can't be built from scratch, so you'll need to purchase them. If there is no drone retailer nearby, many hobby stores that carry model rockets and R/C airplanes will carry them.[2]You will need to purchase speed controllers, a power distribution board, and a flight controller along with the motors and propellers. Note that most modern flight controller comes integrated with power distribution board.If you have trouble finding the parts you need, many drone specific online retailers, as well as large retailers like Amazon, carry these parts.Drone engines should be rated to produce a total of twice as much thrust as the drone weighs. If your quadcopter will weigh 800 grams (28oz), each engine should produce 400 grams (14oz) so the combined total amount of thrust will equal 1,600 grams (56oz).Make sure the speed controller current rating is higher than that of your motor.You can often buy these components in bundles.\n",
            "Drill holes in the frame to support the motors.\n",
            "Most motors mount using anywhere from 2 to 4 screws. Place one motor at the end of one of the drone's extended arms and make marks where the holes need to be drilled. Then use those holes to guide you when using the drill. If you are using self-setting wood screws on a wood or plastic frame, drill the holes smaller than the diameter of the screws so they can work as a guide.If you are using metal, drill holes of the same diameter of the mounting bolts you'll use. You will then need to use nuts on the underside of the bolts to secure them in place.\n",
            "Cut 4 .5in (1.3cm) rings from a 4in (10cm) PVC pipe to make landing gear.\n",
            "Lay the pipe on its side and mark it where you'll make your cut. Then use a saw to cut all four sections, so you're left with 4 plastic rings made of PVC pipe. These four rings will serve as lightweight landing gear for your drone.The cuts don't have to be perfect as long as the rings are thick enough to be sturdy, but the better the finish on your cuts, the better the drone will look.\n",
            "Stand the landing gear rings on their side and attach them with duct tape.\n",
            "Place one ring on its side beneath each arm of the drone's frame, then use thin strips of duct tape to secure the rings to the arms. The drone will now stand on its own on your table. You can use glue instead of tape, but make sure it's completely dry before moving on.Keep the rings in the middle of the arms so they don't interfere with the placement of your motors or other components.\n",
            "Mount the motors on the frame.\n",
            "Place each motor over the holes you drilled for them and then use screws or bolts to secure them in place. Then slide the propellers over the posts extending from the top of the motors and screw the caps that came with the motors over the top of the posts.[3]The drone frame now has landing gear and motors, but the center portion of the frame should still be empty.Tighten the bolts or screws securely so the motors can't wiggle at all on the frame. Any slack will create vibrations that can make the drone unstable.\n",
            "Use zip ties to secure the speed controllers to the bottom of the frame.\n",
            "The electronic speed controllers that connect to the motors should be mounted on the underside of the drone frame to prevent it from getting too top heavy when you add the rest of the components. Zip ties are an easy way to attach them. Run the zip ties through the mounting loops on the speed controllers (or just across them) and over the frame. Then pull the zip ties tight so the controllers are firmly held in place.[4]Don't use glue the first time you assemble your drone, as you may find you want to adjust the positioning of different components based on how it flies.The speed controllers regulate how fast the motors on the drone spin. This ensures all four motors spin at the same speed so the drone will be level as it flies.\n",
            "Secure the battery to the frame.\n",
            "Consider the size and shape of your battery when looking for the right place to mount it. If it's flat, you can mount it in the center of the drone and then mount other components on top of it. If not, you may want to mount the battery on the underside of the drone along with the speed controllers.[5]In most applications, mounting the battery in the center of the top of the frame is the best place.Use zip ties to hold the battery in place so you can remove it and move it if you need to adjust the weight distribution of the drone later.\n",
            "Install the power distribution board.\n",
            "Center the power distribution board on the drone frame, on top of the battery if you placed it there as well. Connect the lines from the speed controllers and the battery to the board once you've zip tied it down.[6]The power distribution board relays the right amount of power to each component to keep the drone operating smoothly.\n",
            "Attach the flight controller to the drone frame with zip ties and connect it.\n",
            "The flight controller relays information from the remote control to the power distribution board. Position it on top of the power distribution board and then zip tie it down. Refer to the instructions for the flight controller and power distribution box to connect them properly, but in most applications, the connection will be one clearly marked wire that plugs directly from one into the other.\n",

            "Drain all water out of your iron.\n",
            "Open the water cap on your iron by popping the top or twisting it counterclockwise until its all the way off. Take your iron to a sink and turn it over to empty out any water in the tank. Water is bad for wood and can cause it to rot, so you need to get all of the moisture out of your iron before you start.[1]If you can access the inside of the tank, wipe it down with a dry paper towel or cloth before reassembling it and putting it back into your iron.The sooner you can do this after the wood has been stained, the easier it will be to remove the stain.This method should be fine for any kind of wood. You can use a hair dryer instead if you dont have an iron, but it will take much longer.\n",
            "Stand the iron up and plug it in to preheat it.\n",
            "Lay an iron on the base and stand the plate up. Turn the dial on the iron to low and plug it in. Wait 5-10 minutes to let it preheat.[2]\n",
            "Lay cotton over the surface of the stain.\n",
            "You can use a shirt, cloth, towel, or rag. The thickness of the cotton will determine how long it takes to iron the stain out, but as long as its made of cotton, it doesnt necessarily matter in terms of how effective it is.\n",
            "Apply the iron to the cotton and iron in a circular pattern.\n",
            "Once your iron is preheated, lay the plate flat on your cotton over the stained area. Begin to slowly move the iron around the stain in a circular pattern. Make sure that you iron at least 48in (1020cm) around the stain in every direction. Iron for 3-4 minutes.[3]Dont let the iron just sit on one spot for more than 20-30 seconds or youll risk burning or warping the wood.\n",
            "Lift the cotton and check the stain to see if you need to keep ironing.\n",
            "Grab the cotton by an unheated edge to avoid burning your hand. Pull the cotton up and inspect the stain to see if it is still there. If the stain is completely gone, youre done.[4]\n",
            "Repeat the process using the same cotton and iron to remove the stain.\n",
            "Use the same piece of cotton and the same iron on the same temperature to continue ironing the stain. Iron for another 4-6 minutes and repeat the process until the stain is gone.[5]This process could take up to 30 minutes depending on how old the stain is.\n",
            "Scoop 1-2 tablespoons (15-30 grams) of mayonnaise into a clean towel and rub it into the cloth.\n",
            "Get a clean, cotton towel or dish rag and scoop some mayonnaise into the center. Hold the edges of the towel so that the mayo sits at the bottom of the towel and rub it into the fabric with your free hand from the other side.[6]Mayonnaise contains eggs, oil, vinegar, and lemon juice. Most of these ingredients are included in furniture polishes and lacquers because theyre good at penetrating wood. The fat in the mayonnaise will absorb the moisture and leave your wood looking clean!If you dont have access to mayonnaise, you can use petroleum jelly instead. Petroleum jelly may leave a weird texture behind after you clean it up though.Mayonnaise should be fine on any kind of wood. It may leave it smelling a little strange afterwards though.\n",
            "Rub the mayonnaise directly into the stain for 30-45 seconds.\n",
            "Unfold your towel and place the center over the stain. Rub the mayonnaise directly into the stained area using firm, circular strokes. Rub the wood and make sure that you cover each area of the stain.[7]\n",
            "Let the mayonnaise soak into the stain for at least 1 hour.\n",
            "Lift your towel up without wiping the mayonnaise away and throw it in the washer or sink to clean it. One hour is the minimum amount of time that you should leave the mayonnaise on the wood. If you want maximum penetration into the wood or the stain is particularly old, leave the mayonnaise on the surface to let it soak overnight.[8]The smell might be kind of funky if you leave the mayonnaise on overnight, but you wont be damaging the wood.\n",
            "Wipe the mayonnaise up and inspect the stain to see if its gone.\n",
            "Get a clean cloth or rag and wipe up the mayonnaise. Check the stain to see if it is still there.[9]You can use a damp cloth to wipe up any dried mayonnaise. Just make sure that you wipe the water and moisture off after you do this.\n",
            "Apply another layer of mayonnaise if the stain isnt gone.\n",
            "If the stain is only partially gone, apply another layer of mayonnaise and repeat the process. If it isnt coming out of the wood, try using a different method to get the stain up.[10]You may need to do this a few times to get the stain completely out.\n",
            "Get a non-gel and non-whitening toothpaste and a clean toothbrush.\n",
            "Gel toothpastes tend to be thinner and weaker, so they may not do as good a job at penetrating the wood. Whitening agents contain chemicals and additives that may not help you clean your stain. Use a clean toothbrush to clean water stains from wood.[11]This method works best if the stain is dark and your wood is lighter. Do not use toothpaste on antique wood.If youre worried about damaging the grain of your wood, use a soft cloth instead of toothpaste.\n",
            "Fill your toothbrush with toothpaste and brush the stain.\n",
            "Load your toothbrush with toothpaste and start to scrub your stain using back-and-forth strokes. Work in the direction of the grain to effectively clean your wood. Brush each section at least 5-6 times to ensure that the toothpaste gets into the wood.[12]\n",
            "Let the toothpaste rest for 10-15 minutes and wipe it off.\n",
            "You dont need to leave it on overnight or anything, but you do need to let the toothpaste sit for a couple of minutes after youre done scrubbing. Wipe the toothpaste up with a dry paper towel.[13]If you leave the toothpaste on for too long, you could discolor the wood.\n",
            "Polish the wood with a clear wood polish and soft cloth.\n",
            "After youve removed the toothpaste, check to see if the stain is gone. If it is, reseal your wood by using a wood polish. Spray some polish into a clean cloth and rub it into the wood. Wipe in the direction of the grain and let it air dry for 24 hours before you put anything on the wood.[14]Follow the manufacturers directions by reading the label on your wood polish before applying it. Some polishes have specific directions that you need to follow.Use a clear polish so that you dont change the color of your wood.\n",
            "Scrape stains on finished wood away with extra-fine steel wool.\n",
            "Dip some steel wool in mineral oil. Scrape the stain in the direction of the wood grain. Go lightly at first to avoid ripping the wood up and try to only use the amount of pressure necessary to lift the stain out of the wood. Wipe excess oil off of the wood after the stain has disappeared by running a paper towel over the surface.[15]Its not a good idea to use abrasives on antique wood if you care about the value.\n",
            "Strip layers off of unfinished wood with sandpaper.\n",
            "If the wood isnt polished, finished, or stained, you can simply remove layers of your wood until the stained layers are gone. Start with a sheet of 120 grit sandpaper before stepping up to something coarser. Scrape the entire layer of the woods surface using back-and-forth strokes until the entire layer is gone. Wipe up wood shavings and dust with a dry cloth.[16]You can use a belt sander if you want to remove stains from a larger surface and keep the pattern uniform.This will change the style and pattern of your grain.\n",
            "Use paint remover to get stains off of oak furniture.\n",
            "If your furniture is pure oak, you can use paint remover to lift it up. Put on some rubber gloves and fill a small cup or paint tray with paint remover. Dip a clean, natural brush in the paint remover and apply it to the stain by using back-and-forth strokes. Work in the direction of the grain. Use a clean rag to wipe it up after youve let it soak for 4-5 minutes.Try to avoid getting paint remover on the unstained areas of your wood. It may cause some discoloration if your wood is stained.[17]To stiffen the paint remover, you can make a 1-part paint remover and 1-part 5% bleach combination. Apply the solution in the exact same way to remove your water stain.\n",

Put the cartridge in the slot with the dark side facing up and the metal contacts facing down, then close the flap.[1]If your Polaroid camera has an old cartridge that youd like to preserve, remove the film in a completely dark room and place the cartridge in a container that protects it from any light exposure.\n",
            "Wait for a dark slide to pop out of your camera.\n",
            "Immediately after youve loaded your film, a dark slide should emerge from your camera. This indicates that the camera is working properly and is ready for use![2]If a dark slide does not come out of the camera, it likely means that theres a problem with your film or camera. If youve purchased new film, you might have a problem with the camera itself. Test with another cartridge to determine the problem.You may want to save this dark slide, as you can use it as a cover to protect your photos during their exposure time after they emerge from the camera.\n",

            "These cameras require you to wake them up before use. Examine your model to determine whether youll need to open and close your flash bar or flip it up. These cameras turn off quickly, so simply repeat the process whenever youre ready to take a picture.[3]If you cant see your flashbar on a 600-series Polaroid OneStep camera, that means you have a model that requires you to flip it up.Polaroid SX-70 Land cameras do not have an on/off button. These cameras are ready to use as soon as your film is loaded.[4]\n",
            "Play with your exposure compensation switch to fix exposure problems.\n",
            "A cameras exposure refers to the camera and films sensitivity to light, which will then be captured in the image. Most OneStep models include a small slider that increases or decreases the amount of light the camera will let in. Experiment with multiple shots at different exposure levels to see what produces the best results for your film and camera.[5]If youre shooting with Impossible Project SX-70 film, move the switch toward the darker side. This film has higher light sensitivity, which will make images appear over-exposed if the switch remains in the middle of the slider.\n",
            "Stand at least 4 feet (1.22 m) away from your subject.\n",
            "Because OneStep cameras contain fixed-focus lenses, they use distance, or depth of field, to focus on their subjects. They dont contain the electronics necessary for autofocus. Provide enough distance between yourself and your chosen subject to allow the camera to produce a sharp image. You may need to experiment with distance when taking photographs with Polaroid cameras. Some models may produce better images at a distance of about 10 feet (3.04 m). Some models may not work at distances above 10 feet (3.04 m), so be patient and get ready to test out your camera.Some models may include a closeup setting that is supposed to allow you take pictures of subjects located under 4 feet (1.22 m) away from you. Unfortunately, these settings generally dont work very well. Ignore them, and adhere to the 4-foot (1.22-m) rule.[6]\n",
            "Use the viewfinder to frame your shot.\n",
            "Unlike most modern cameras, the viewfinder doesnt allow you to see through the cameras lens. Since the viewfinder doesnt provide you with a perfect replica of what the image will be, give yourself plenty of room on either side of your chosen subject when framing your shot.[7]\n",
            "Push down the trigger to snap a photo.\n",
            "Once youre ready to go, taking a picture with a Polaroid OneStep is about as easy as it gets. No need for adjustments. Just push down your button, take the picture, and get ready to view your handiwork![8]\n",
            "Protect your photograph from the light to prevent damage.\n",
            "When your pictures pop out of your camera, keep them from getting exposed to light. You can either immediately place them in a pocket or light-safe container, or cover them with a piece of paper. This will ensure that the chemical process necessary for development works properly.[9]\n",
            "Wait at least 10 and up to 30 minutes before viewing your photos.\n",
            "Keep your photos face-down or shielded from light the entire time theyre developing. While some old Polaroid film may be ready within 90 seconds, its safer to wait longer. If youre using the Impossible Projects new film, be especially cautious. Youd rather have a properly developed picture after a half-hour than a dud after five minutes.[10]The Impossible Project recommends waiting 10 minutes for black-and-white film and 30 for color film.\n",
            "Shoot outdoors for best results.\n",
            "Polaroid cameras respond well to lots of natural light. They do best with outdoor shots taken on either sunny or slightly overcast days. When youre starting out, try taking landscape shots first. This will allow you to get comfortable with your camera.[11]\n",
            "Avoid extreme heat or cold when shooting with Impossible film.\n",
            "This new film does best in temperate temperatures between about 55 (13) and 82 (28). Cold weather may lead to overexposed prints that dont contain color contrast, while hot days could give you pictures with a red or yellow tint. To shoot at higher or lower temperatures, either heat up the film by placing it in a pocket and using your body heat or cool it down by putting in the refrigerator before taking your photos.\n",
            "Use Polaroid 600-series cameras for indoor photography.\n",
            "SX-70 film generally isnt light-sensitive enough to produce good indoor pictures. Because Polaroid cameras need so much light to give you clear images, its important to choose a camera thats compatible with more light-sensitive film.[12]\n",
            "Fire the flash indoors to add to any natural-light sources.\n",
            "Use the built-in flash on your camera. While the flash may produce harsh lighting in some of your pictures, its important to start with the flash in order to see how best to lighten up your indoor pictures.[13]If you can, shoot in a room with plenty of windows to benefit from natural light even when indoors.\n",
            "Cut out a square of paper to tape over your flashbar.\n",
            "Most older Polaroid cameras are designed for the flash to be in use at all times, so its often difficult or impossible to manually shut it off. If you want to see what turning off the flash does for your photos, use a small piece of dark-colored paper and some tape to cover the bulb.[14]\n",

            "You can buy epiphyllum cactus cuttings from a garden center or an online plant store.Cactus cuttings are sections of a mature stem which are planted and used to grow a whole new plant.[1]If you already own an epiphyllum cactus that is strong and healthy, you can make your cuttings. Choose a healthy leaf of approximately 4 inches (10 cm) and cut it off at the stem below the base of the leaf. Repeat this process until you have obtained the desired number of cuttings.\n",
            "Store cuttings in a cool, dry place away from the sun for 10-14 days.\n",
            "Good places include a garden shed, bathroom, or basement.  Because the epiphyllum cactus is a succulent plant, cuttings can remain good for up to a month.Storing the cuttings will allow them to cure.  The purpose of curing the cuttings is to allow calluses to form over the ends of the cutting. The calluses protect the cuttings from rot.If you purchased the cuttings and don't know exactly when they were made, cure them for a week before planting.\n",
            "Plant three cuttings in a 4-inch pot with a drainage hole in the center of the base.\n",
            "This will allow adequate room for the cactus to grow while the drainage hole will prevent over-watering.Plastic pots are preferable to terracotta pots, as they will allow the soil to retain moisture for a longer period.Choose potting mix for epiphyllum cacti. This consists of three parts potting soil mixed with one part of coarse non-organic material such as perlite, which is also referred to as sponge rock. The non-organic material should be 1/8 to 1/2 inch (1/3 to 1 1/4 cm) in diameter. You can also add 1 to 1 1/2 tbsp. of orchid bark per pot.Alternatively, you can plant the cuttings in pure perlite. However, once the cuttings have developed roots, you will have to move them to the epiphyllum potting mix.The potting mix should always be damp, never wet.  This will ensure healthy and faster growth.\n",
            "Refrain from watering the cuttings until they are well-rooted.\n",
            "If you water them too soon, the cuttings will rot.To check for rot, tug gently on each cutting. If you feel any resistance, this is good because it means the cutting is rooting. You can water the cutting.If a cutting has rotted, take it out of the pot, cut away the rot, cure the cutting, and pot it again.\n",
            "Decide where you want to grow your cactus.\n",
            "Unless you live in a warm climate where temperatures seldom dip below 50 F (10 C), your epiphyllum cactus will do best indoors or in a heated greenhouse.[2]If you plant your cactus outside, it will need to be out of direct sunlight. A spot under a tree or a wood lattice that lets in filtered light is ideal.If you keep your cactus indoors or in a greenhouse, make sure to provide moderate to high humidity for your cactus. You can do this by placing the pot on top of a tray filled with gravel and a little bit of water.\n",
            "Place the epiphyllum cacti in hanging containers in filtered sunlight.\n",
            "Epiphyllum cacti love growing in hanging containers, and doing so will provide a good base for the pendulous growth of the plant. As a bonus, hanging containers make it harder for snails  the number 1 epiphyllum pests  to get to the plants.A shady spot under a tree or beneath a shade structure made of cloth or lath provides the right amount of light.  If grown in direct sunlight, cacti can get burnt.  If set in too shady an area, the cactus can become overly lush and will be shy to produce flowers.  Also, the long stems won't be strong enough to hold themselves up and will fall over, sustaining damage.If possible, choose walls or eaves that face east or north for the best lighting.Ensure good air circulation but protect the plants from storms and strong winds.  Windstorms may cause hanging baskets to swing against each other and long stems to whip around, causing breakage.\n",
            "Water your cactus every few days or every day in hot weather.\n",
            "The soil should never be completely dry, but should also never remain wet after watering.Check the soil regularly to gauge whether you need to add water.When you water, make sure to add enough water so that any excess water flows out of the drainage holes. This will rinse out the soil and prevent the accumulation of soluble salts in the soil.\n",
            "Lightly fertilize your cactus with a time-release fertilizer.\n",
            "Epiphyllum cacti bloom best when you give them regular, light fertilizer applications.Feed your epiphyllum cactus at each watering time from May to late August.  After this period, only fertilize every other watering time.Only use about one-third to one-half the amount of fertilizer that is recommended on the label.  Since cacti naturally grow in relatively low nutrient environments, they won't require as many nutrients for healthy growth.During the winter, fertilize with a low or no nitrogen fertilizer.  Use a 2-10-10 or a 0-10-10 formulation.  After the blossoming season is past, fertilize with a balanced formulation like 10-10-10 or 5-5-5.\n",
            "Move your cactus to warmer spots during cold spells.\n",
            "Frost and prolonged temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.5 degrees Celsius) are harmful to epiphyllum cacti.Cover your cactus with a blanket or cardboard box for better protection.  Epiphyllum cacti are also vulnerable against hail, which may not be big enough to break the stems but can cause unsightly scars where each hailstone has struck.The most optimal time to plant cacti is during the period from April to September.  This will ensure a warm, sunny atmosphere while also avoiding direct sunlight that may hinder growth.\n",
            "Repot the plants after 1 to 2 years.\n",
            "Changing the potting mix will resupply the nutrients that will have naturally been absorbed by your cactusEach plant's size will determine when you need to repot it. A plant that is growing well and is beginning to get too big for the pot will need to be moved to a bigger pot, while a plant that remains small can stay in the same pot for longer.Use 7 to 8 inch (17.5 to 20 cm) plastic pots with the same drainage holes and potting mix.Wrap newspaper around the stem of each plant to prevent damage.Holding the plant around the base of the stem, turn it upside down, and carefully tap the pot against a hard surface such as the underside of a table to loosen the soil from the inside of the pot.  Gently pull the pot away from the plant and remove the old soil.Examine the roots. If any show signs of rot or any other damage cut them away as close to the plant as possible.Don't be discouraged if you haven't noticed any flowers; an epiphyllum cactus will not bloom until it has grown to the size of its pot, which usually occurs 3 to 4 years after planting the cutting.\n",
            "Disinfect your pruning shears with a bleach-water solution.\n",
            "This will prevent your cactus from sustaining diseases or other infections that can affect growth.Use a 10% diluted bleach solution, mixing 1 part chlorine bleach with 1 part water.\n",
            "Clip off flowers after the blossoms expire.\n",
            "Make your cut just below the flower head.Pruning dead parts of the plant not only improves its appearance, but it will also encourage new growth and healthy blossoming.\n",
            "Cut all dead, diseased, and broken stems back to the point of origin on the main stem.\n",
            "When you locate a stem to remove, follow it back to the base of the stem and make a straight cut just outside the joint of the parent stem.Immediately disinfect shears after trimming dead or diseased stems.  This will keep the disease from spreading throughout the plant.It is best to assume that any dead stem died as a result of a disease.  Disinfecting after each pruning session may require more bleach, but it will keep your cactus healthy and beautiful.\n",
            "Remove any long stems that disrupt the balance of the epiphyllum.\n",
            "Trace them back to the parent stem and cut at the base.These stems are usually located along the outer edges.  Remove stems as needed until all sides of the plant are fairly uniform.\n",
            "Inspect your cactus for mealybugs, scale insects, and spider mites.\n",
            "Snails are fairly simple to spot and remove (use store-bought snail bait), but the aforementioned bugs require specific measures for preventing infestation.Mealybugs have a waxy, white, cottony appearance.  They are slow-moving and usually are in clusters along leaf veins or spines, on the underside of leaves, and in hidden areas at the joints.[3]Scale insects resemble small, cottony dome-shaped shells.  They attach themselves to stems and leaves but can be pried off.Spider-mites are hard to see with the naked eye, but signs of infestation include webbing and small brown dots, especially on younger growth.  If you tap the affected area of the plant over a piece of white paper, spider-mites will resemble dust.[4]These insects tend to suck the plant's juices resulting in weak, wrinkled, or shriveled leaves.  Severe infestations can result in the death of the plant.  The first symptoms can include stickiness or black mold on or near the plant.\n",
            "Remove mealybugs and scale insects with cotton swabs dipped in alcohol.\n",
            "You can also spray with a diluted alcohol solution of 1 parts alcohol and 3 parts water.Spraying is best for fighting spider-mite infestation and other hard-to-spot bugs.  Be cautious, however, as this may damage the epidermis of the cactus.  Test a small area before spraying the entire plant.\n",
            "Use insecticidal soap to coat the plant.\n",
            "Insecticidal soap can be purchased at your local garden or home improvement store.This treatment may also damage your cactus.  Since cacti have oils and waxes that make them susceptible to damage, it is best to use it sparingly and to test a small area before washing the entire cactus.\n",
            "Spray with insecticides to kill bugs and stop serious infestation.\n",
            "Use insecticides like Neem or pyrethrins for visible bugs.  Systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid or Acephate are best for controlling pests that aren't as easily accessible.Consult the label to see how much you should use on your cactus and whether or not prolonged use is safe.\n",
            "Quarantine new plants from infested plants.\n",
            "Remember that infestation isn't just harmful, it is contagious and will spread from plant to plant until it is stopped.Check new plants carefully for the previously mentioned symptoms and bugs.  If you are sure it is pest free, keep it in an area far away from the infected plants.  If you do find pests on your new plants, it may be best to simply discard it rather than treat it to save you time, money, and effort.[5]\n",

            "Describe your mission and objectives.\n",
            "Under the heading Company Description you should describe your company in more detail. This section fleshes out some of the information provided in the executive summary. For example, you can mention the following: Your mission. What is your driving goal every day? Dont simply write, Make money. Identify how you will make money. For example, you can write: Our mission is to offer residents of the Lakeview neighborhood the best day spa experience in the Near North Side of Chicago. We are committed to providing value and quality in a fun atmosphere that is never predictable.Your goals. For example, a day spay might have the following goal: To attract a minimum of 35 customers each day in the first year of operations. Make your goals as concrete as possible.Description of the industry. Explain whether the industry is growing or poised for growth in the short and long term.The factors that will drive your success. How will you set yourself apart? For example, You All Day will separate itself from the pack based on the owners deep experience running a day spa in Seattle for ten years. This experience includes familiarity with successful marketing techniques and trends analysis.Your legal form. Are you a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation? Also explain why you selected this form.\n",
            "Discuss your industry.\n",
            "Include a section under the heading Industry Analysis and talk about your industry at a high level. For example, discuss whether the total industry is growing and how quickly. Also talk about trends in consumer preferences. Youll need to do research, so go to the library and ask your librarian for help finding information about the industry.[1]You can search for industry information in other places. For example, talk to people in your industry at trade shows. Also search online. Many industries have trade associations, which have websites with information.For example, when analyzing the day spa industry, you might want to talk about how it is growing because more upper-income men in urban areas are visiting. (If thats true).By analyzing the industry, you gain insight as to your likely target market and how you can reach them.\n",
            "Identify your target market.\n",
            "Although it might be nice to think the entire world is your market, businesses usually service a niche. You need to identify that niche. For example, think about the following characteristics of your target market: Age. What is the average age of your likely customer? If you dont know, then visit similar businesses and note the ages of the clientele.Gender. Will men or womenor bothprimarily use your products or services?Location. Generally, your market will be located near your business. However, if you have a web-based business, your target audience could have no geographic boundaries.Income level.Occupation. For example, a day spa might target stressed-out white collar professionals.Education level. There is often a link between education, income, and occupationthough not always. For example, a discount bookstore might target an educated audience that nevertheless has a lower income.\n",
            "Scope out your competition.\n",
            "Who will you be competing with? Identify your competitors. For most businesses, your competitors will be located nearby. However, if you have an Internet-based business, your competitors could be any business offering similar products or services.[2]To find competitors, look in the phone book and do a general Google search. Make sure to read their website and stop into the business.If youre opening a restaurant, youll want to see a sample menu, as well as the hours of operation.Also identify indirect competitors. For example, a day spa is competing with more than other spas. You also compete with any business that offers relaxation, such as massage parlors or meditation centers.\n",
            "Draft a competitive analysis.\n",
            "Once youve studied your competition, explain in your business plan how you will stack up. You can create a chart, which should contain the following:[3]Name of your competitor.What you offer that they dont. Think about products and services, but also location, ease of ordering, etc. What will make the consumer experience different at your business?What they offer that you dont. Identify why you dont offer their products or services. For example, they may be serving multiple niches while you are focused on only one. Alternately, they may have a favorable location.\n",
            "Describe your products and services.\n",
            "Go into detail about what products or services you will offer and how you will offer them. For example, if you are starting a pizza shop, then you will want to include the following:[4]Whether you will sell pizza by the slice, as whole pies, or bothHow big your pizzas will beWhat toppings your customers can offerIf you will have take-out and delivery optionsWhat other food items will be sold\n",
            "Devise your marketing plan\n",
            ". After identifying your market, you should explain how you will reach it. Consider the following and include it in your business plan under the marketing section:[5]What type of advertising or promotion will you use? How often will you use paid promotion?What other promotion other than paid advertising will you use? For example, you might use social media, professional networks, etc.Will you create a logo and use it on cards, letterhead, websites, etc.?How large will your promotional budget be?\n",
            "Explain your daily operations.\n",
            "Give your reader some idea of how many people will be working for the startup. You should identify their positions. If you have 10 or more employees, then create an organizational chart. This chart should identify the hierarchy in the business.State how much you expect to pay each employee in your first three years of business.Also name your professional support, such as your business lawyer, accountant, and insurance agent. Professionals are independent contractors you use but dont employ. Calculate how much you expect to spend on each professional.\n",
            "Identify management.\n",
            "If youre running a sole proprietorship, this is easy. However, larger startups will need to identify who will run the business and provide a little information about their backgrounds. For example, you should identify the daily manager, support staff, etc.[6]You might write: Lisa Jones is the sole proprietor of You All Day and will run day-to-day operations. As a certified massage therapist, she ran the Relax! chain of day spas in the Greater Seattle area for ten years. A former accountant, Lisa has an MS in accounting from the University of New Hampshire and worked as a CPA briefly before going into the spa business.If you are asking for a loan, then include resumes for each owner. You can put them in the appendix at the end of the document.\n",
            "Provide personal financial statements.\n",
            "As a startup, banks will look at your personal credit history and financial situation when deciding whether to make a loan. Accordingly, youll need to include information for each business owner.[7]You should create professional-looking financial statements using a spreadsheet.Youll have to gather quite a bit of information to make the financial statement. For example, you will need information on your assets, investments, and personal debts.You might also want to get a free copy of your credit report and review it as you draft your business plan.\n",
            "Explain your start-up costs.\n",
            "Youll need to research how much it costs to start your business. If youve created a similar business before, then you can rely on that information. If not, you should talk to other business owners. Be conservative when estimating startup costs. Generally, everything will cost more than you expect.[8]Common startup costs include insurance, licenses, equipment, advertising, and employee expenses.[9]Also identify the source of the startup capital. For example, if your startup has three initial owners, state how much each is contributing to the business and their ownership percentage.If you need financing, state how much. Include the terms of any proposed loan.\n",
            "Forecast profits for the first year.\n",
            "As a startup, you have no financial information you can provide. Accordingly, you need to estimate your sales based on your research, industry data, and marketing strategies. You should provide best case and worst case scenarios.[10] Use spreadsheets so that your forecasts look professional.Youll need to make some assumptions in order to come up with a forecast of sales. You should explain these assumptions in your business plan.For example, you can write, We assume continued interest in day spas in the Chicago area.Another assumption is the overall health of the economy. Although the Chicagoland economy has grown more slowly than other regions of the country, we assume that the Chicago economy will grow on par with other large metropolitan areas in the coming decade.You can also include a four-year projection, though this is optional.\n",
            "Identify expected cash flow.\n",
            "You need cash on hand to make payments and cover anything unexpected. You will need positive cash flow, otherwise your business might go under. As part of your cash flow analysis, you need to project the cash coming in each year and how much cash is spent on expenditures, such as sales tax, bill payments, and purchasing assets.[11]Also talk about how you will build up your cash reserves. For example: In addition to normal cash flow, we will focus on obtaining sufficient cash reserves for emergencies. These reserves include a line of credit with a bank, which we can use when business is slow. We will also invest excess cash in certificates of deposits at our bank.\n",
            "Provide a break-even analysis.\n",
            "Your break even point is the moment when your revenue equals all of your business costs. There are many business costs you need to account for:[12]Fixed costs: these dont vary depending on your sales volume. For example, your rent, employee salaries, and insurance are fixed costs.Variable costs: these fluctuate depending on your sales and include shipping, inventory, and manufacturing costs.\n",
            "Format your document.\n",
            "Make the business plan look as professional as possible. Open a word processing document and set the font to Times New Roman or Garamond.[13]Add a cover page to your document. You can title it [Company Name]s Business Plan or Business Plan for [Your Name]. If you have a logo, include that too.\n",
            "Draft your executive summary.\n",
            "In the first section, you should summarize your business as briefly as possible. For example, you should mention what products or services you offer and where you are located. You should also briefly explain why you think you will succeed. You might want to write this summary last, but it goes first.[14]For example, you can write, You All Day is a start-up dedicated to providing men and women in Chicago a high-quality day spa experience at an affordable price. We specialize in pedicures, manicures, massage, and herbal aromatherapy. The Near North Side of Chicago has grown substantially over the past 20 years, with young, educated millennials settling in to start families. This area is currently under served, and we hope You All Day can meet the demand of the local market.\n",
            "Assemble the pieces.\n",
            "You might write bits and pieces of your business plan over several months. However, you need to put it all together into one document.

            "Add attachments in the appendix.\n",
            "This material should go in the back of the business plan. Make sure to clearly label each attachment. For example, if you include a resume then identify it: A: Lisa Jones Resume or something similar. Make sure your label is the same as what is mentioned in the body of the business plan.\n",
            "Review your business plan.\n",
            "Once youve finished a draft put it aside for a few days. When you take it back out, review with a critical eye. Does the business plan make sense? Is it too repetitive? Is it hard to read?[16]Review for typos and other errors. An accountant should check your numbers to make sure they are accurate.Analyze the overall presentation. Is the information crammed in so that the document is tiring to read? If so, spread out the information so that there is a lot of white space on each page.You can also show the plan to a business adviser. If you live in the U.S., you can show it to someone at your nearest Small Business Development Center, which provides help drafting business plans. You can find your nearest SBDC by visiting this website: https://www.sba.gov/tools/local-assistance/sbdc.\n",
            "Print and bind the plan.\n",
            "Use quality paperthe brightest white you can find. If you have pie charts or other graphics, youll want to print in color. Bind the plan using a three-ring binder or more sophisticated methods of binding available at Staples or other printers.You might want to include tabbed partitions between each section of your business plan. This will make it easier for someone to flip through it and find what they are looking for.\n",

            "Discuss this decision as a couple and a family.\n",
            "In the rush of happiness, it may not seem like there is any downside, but a stepparent adoption is a monumental change for your family. This adoption will legally remove one of the child's biological  parents from his/her life, give him/her a new name, and transform his/her stepparent into his/her legal mom or dad.  [1] This is a huge change psychologically for the child. For the biological parent, it means agreeing to give legal rights to the child over to a new spouse.Consider sessions with a family counselor. This helps to make sure everyone understands what a stepparent adoption means to the family, and helps ensure it's what the child wants.\n",
            "Understand the legal ramifications.\n",
            "A stepparent adoption has permanent legal consequences for the biological parent, the adopting parent, and the child.[2] You need to understand and accept them. Consult with an attorney if you have any questions.The biological parent needs to know that this adoption makes your current spouse the child's legal parent. If you divorce, your spouse has the right to visitation and even custody. If you remarry again and want the new spouse to adopt your child, you will be seeking the consent of the adoptive parent, not the biological parent.The adopting parent takes on all legal rights and responsibilities of parenthood. If you divorce, you will be required to pay child support for your adopted stepchild. Your adopted child gains the right to a share of your estate, even if that lessens the share that goes to your biological children.The child forfeits all claims to inheritance from previous family. The absent parent, grandparents, and other relatives of the parent who gave up rights in the adoption may make voluntary gifts to the child, but there is no standing to contest a will or claim a statutory share of the estate.\n",
            "Assemble your documents.\n",
            "At a minimum you will need a certified copy of the child's birth certificate, your marriage documents, and the biological parents' divorce documents (if they were married.) If the absent parent is deceased, you should get a certified copy of the death certificate.If the non-custodial parent is living, you will need an address for service of the petition. If you don't have an address, you need to make honest efforts to find it. The minimum efforts the court will expect include Internet searches, contacting his/her family, looking in phone directories, and reaching out to former friends. Document these efforts in a journal so you will remember them.\n",
            "List the child's property and collect documentation.\n",
            "When you become an adoptive parent, you may gain rights in the child's property. This can include Social Security payments, military survivor benefits, trust funds gained through inheritance, awards in lawsuits, land or other tangible property that belongs to the child. This must be declared in the adoption petition.\n",
            "Decide if you need a family law attorney or will represent yourself.\n",
            "If the absent parent is willing to consent to the adoption or is deceased, the stepchild adoption procedure is fairly straightforward, and you may be able  to do it yourself. If the other parent won't consent, consider consulting with a family law attorney before you file the adoption.\n",
            "Research the adoption fees.\n",
            "There will be a filing fee to apply to the court to adopt your stepchild. Those fees may be nominal (as low as $20 in California), to over $300 in Texas. Payment will be required at the time you file the petition. Other costs could include an adoption home study, attorney's fees for the child's attorney, criminal history checks, court-mandated counseling, and fees for a new birth certificate. Although it varies per state, in total, it typically costs $1500-$2500 to adopt a stepchild, even if you have the other parent's consent, and even if you don't use a lawyer (because one will often be appointed for the child). All courts have a process for waiving some or all of the filing fees. It is dependent on your family income and assets. Ask the court clerk for the procedure in your local court.\n",
            "Complete your adoption petition.\n",
            "The petition is the legal document you will file with the court requesting the judge to allow you to adopt your stepchild. If there is more than one child, you can adopt them all at once with the same petition. An adoption petition is a precise document that must be tailored to your state. Missing a detail or not using the right forms can cause problems for you and the child later on. Therefore, it's not recommended that you write your own from scratch unless you have legal training. There are several options for the preparation of your adoption petition.Ask the court clerk if they have a fill-in-the-blanks stepparent adoption package. These forms will have been vetted for accuracy and accepted by the court before in adoptions. Expect the cost to be around $10.Contact your local Legal Aid office to see if they have a do-it-yourself stepparent adoption package. The forms have been reviewed by an attorney and will comply with local requirements. Expect the cost to be from free-of-charge to under $10. [3]Hire a local legal document preparation service or attorney who offers unbundled legal services. The cost can range from around $50 to $200 depending on the jurisdiction. This is a good option if you are petitioning the court for a stepparent adoption and you do not have the explicit consent of the absent parent.Once complete, you will file your petition, with the fee, in the courthouse of the county where you have lived with the child for at least six months. You must file in your county of residence, even if another courthouse is closer.\n",
            "Obtain the consent of the non-custodial parent.\n",
            "This can either be the easiest part of the adoption process or the hardest. Your adoption package will have a form the absent parent can sign and have notarized to indicate their consent. If (s)he is willing to sign, the adoption can usually proceed with no difficulty.Once the adoption is complete, the non-custodial parent is freed from all further child support obligations. Past due support can still be collected, but no further support will accrue. [4]If the other biological parent is deceased, this will be noted in the petition and a certified copy of the death certificate attached.\n",
            "Adjust your adoption strategy if the other parent won't consent.\n",
            "There are two common scenarios where you can't get consent from the other parent. First, is that the absent parent is hostile toward the idea and refuses to consent. The second is when the absent parent is truly absent and you don't know how to contact him/her.If you believe the adoption will be hostile and contested by the other parent, you should consult with an attorney before you proceed. A non-cooperative parent seriously complicates the procedure and may result in a trial. Unless you have specific legal training and experience, the trial could not only result in denial of your adoption, but a challenge to the custodial spouse's rights of custody.\n",
            "Attempt to locate an absent parent.\n",
            "If you do not have contact information for the absent parent, there is an extra set of steps you will have to go through. It is highly recommended that you consult with an attorney to make sure you know your state's requirements for dealing with a non-involved and missing parent. [5]State laws vary, and it is critical that you follow the law in your state. A good general rule is that if your child has not heard from his/her other parent for over a year, and there has been no financial support for over a year, then the court will grant your adoption.[6] However, this is only a general rule. Local rules vary tremendously.You should make a reasonable good faith effort to locate the other parent. Reach out to family and mutual friends. Search the Internet and phone directories. [7] Some states have a \"putative parent directory,\" where people trying to locate their children register. Document your efforts. If the judge does not believe that you were diligent, the adoption will be delayed or even dismissed.\n",
            "Seek permission for service by publication.\n",
            "If your efforts to locate the absent parent fail, you can ask the court for permission for service by publication. This means that the notice will be published in whatever newspaper is most local to the biological parent's last known address. After service by publication, you can proceed with the stepparent adoption. If your court does not have a prepared form for this request, consult an attorney, document preparation service, or local Legal Aid for help. Once the judge grants permission for publication, go to the newspaper in your county authorized to print legal notices. They will help you prepare the notice for the newspaper and give you proof of publication according to your state law. The fee will be around $100 and cannot be waived by the court. [8]\n",
            "Attend the preliminary court hearing.\n",
            "After the service period has expired, there is usually a preliminary court hearing where the judge will review the documents, note any deficiencies, and schedule the next step in the adoption.This is the absent parent's opportunity to appear. If (s)he does appear, you can either talk to him/her about consent or consider your next move if (s)he refuses. If the absent parent does not appear, you are not required to give him/her any further notice. You are also not required to make any further attempts to contact him/her unless explicitly ordered to by the judge.Be sure to comply with any orders issued by the judge. If the court wants additional documentation or information, supply it as soon as possible without question. If the judge orders criminal background checks, you may be required to meet with a court officer and sign a release so they can get your information.\n",
            "Prepare for a home study.\n",
            "While home studies are usually waived in stepparent adoptions, judges still have the authority to order them. Home studies are conducted by child protective services (or whatever that agency might be called in your state). Cooperate and put your family's best foot forward by welcoming the social worker into your home and answering all of his/her questions. [9]The court has the discretion to order a criminal background check on the adopting parent. If the adopting parent has a record of charges involving child abuse or neglect, or his or her own history of back child support or abandonment, the court will be much more unlikely to grant the adoption.The judge may or may not want to meet the children. This is completely up to the judge. Some judges do not allow young children in the courtroom at all. It is best to have child care arranged before the court hearing. Ask the judge if (s)he wants you to bring the children to the final hearing.If your child is over a certain age--usually fourteen--then the judge will have to get his or her consent in order for adoption to proceed, as well.\n",
            "Attend the final court hearing.\n",
            "At this hearing, the judge will make his/her ruling on your stepparent adoption. This is also the last chance for the absent parent to appear. The judge will review the documents and ask you about your intent to adopt the child. (S)he will also ask your spouse if (s)he consents to your adoption of his/her child and changing the child's last name. If the children are present, the judge may talk to them. Upon signing of the order, you become the legal parent of your stepchild.You may be scheduled during the regular court docket. Even though this is a joyous time for you, the court may have other business to conduct. Definitely don't bring a large group, cameras, balloons, or anything else that may interfere with court operations. Judges are not a group of people known for their joviality. Save the party for later.Some courts schedule special \"adoption dockets\" that are more relaxed and festive. At these special settings, judges will usually allow photos and a party-like atmosphere.\n",
            "Change your child's birth certificate.\n",
            "Upon receipt of the file-stamped adoption order you can file for a new birth certificate showing your child's adopted name and proceed with updating school and medical records.\n",

            "4 Ways to Explain Lent to a Child - wikiHow\n",
            "Tell the story of Jesus life.\n",
            "If you want your child to accept the Christian faith and its major traditions, its important to talk about Jesus regularly  and not just during holidays. Read about Jesus life in the Bible, and search for kid-friendly Lenten or Easter themed books online or at your favorite bookstore.In the context of Lent, emphasize that Jesus was born and lived on Earth for one purpose  to show everyone how to achieve salvation and everlasting life.  Note that he accepted and embraced this calling, despite his own suffering, because of the eternal glory that it would make available to all of us.\n",
            "Explain Jesus death in an age-appropriate way.\n",
            "You do not need to dwell on the gruesome details of crucifixion, which can upset and frighten younger children, but you should introduce Jesus death. Emphasize the reasons for Jesus sacrifice, that he gave up his earthly life so that believers could have eternal salvation.For preschoolers, stick to saying that Jesus died and rose from the dead for us.For younger school kids, add in some more details about the death and resurrection.  Note that it shows that death is not the end, but rather the beginning of eternal life.Younger teens and beyond can better handle the details of crucifixion and comprehend the symbolism of death and rebirth vis-a-vis mankinds salvation.\n",
            "Introduce the meaning of Easter.\n",
            "Teach your child that Easter is the most important Christian holiday  yes, more important than Christmas  and far more than just bunnies, eggs, and chocolate. Easter Sunday celebrates Jesus return from the dead. The concepts of resurrection and life after death are fundamental to the Christian faith, so introduce them early.Tell younger kids that all the celebrating that surrounds Easter should remind us of the joy of knowing how much Jesus loves us, and that he showed us the path to eternal life.Lent, then, is meant to be a time of reflection and focus, so that the faithful can be truly prepared to comprehend the power and glory of Easter Sunday.\n",
            "Explain Ash Wednesday.\n",
            "Lent begins with Ash Wednesday, which, for many believers, includes a symbolic drawing of a cross with ashes on the forehead. The ashes are meant to remind everyone of human mortality (i.e., ashes to ashes, dust to dust), but its not necessary to push this idea too forcefully on young children. Be matter-of-fact about the tradition.If it helps, talk less about death and emphasize how the drawn cross is meant to be a reminder of the main focus of Lent  Jesus.\n",
            "Highlight the significance of the forty days.\n",
            "Tell your child that Lent lasts for forty days because thats how long Jesus wandered in the desert, fasting, while he resisted Satans temptations. Explain that your child has an opportunity, during the forty days of Lent, to be like Jesus. They too can resist temptations and use this time to become closer to God.Lent isnt simply a countdown or something to get through  its a chance to set aside distractions and focus on your relationship with the Lord.\n",
            "Honor Holy Week together.\n",
            "Your child should understand that the last week before Easter is especially important. Make sure your child knows that this last portion of Lent leads up to the celebration of Easter.Note that Palm Sunday marks Jesus entry into Jerusalem to cheering crowds, but that within a few days many of those same people would turn against him.  Explain that this shows how quickly anyone can succumb to the temptations of evil and turn away from God.Use Holy (Maundy) Thursday to tell the story of the night before Jesus died, and how he chose to spend his Last Supper with his family of disciples.  Consider making a family meal to correspond with it.\n",
            "Make special note of Good Friday.\n",
            "The day that Jesus died is a sad one for Christians, but you can still make it resonate with a child. Discuss the details of the crucifixion in an age-appropriate fashion, and focus on the sacrifice Jesus made for everyone and the glory he knew was to come afterward.Paint eggs together, but point out that you arent just making something for the Easter Bunny.  Eggs represent the promise of new life, and believers can focus on Jesus coming rebirth even as they commemorate his death.\n",
            "End Holy Week by looking to the joy of Easter.\n",
            "Explain to your child that on Saturday, there is typically no liturgy (save for evening Easter vigils in some traditions), so that the faithful can focus completely on Easter. Talk about Easter with joy and enthusiasm, and explain the symbolism of painted eggs and the wonder of resurrection, salvation, and life with God after death.In some traditions, Holy Saturday is a fast day, and baskets holding the food to be prepared the following day are blessed by the priest.Welcome Easter Sunday with unbridled joy. Pray. Sing. Celebrate. Go to Church. Spend the day together with loved ones.\n",
            "Explain fasting.\n",
            "During Lent, Christians fast in various ways to connect with and honor Jesus, who fasted for forty days in the desert. Note that during Lent, fasting may not always involve food. There are other ways to practice sacrifice and strive for closeness with God.You dont have to expect your child to make a huge, symbolic sacrifice for forty days. But you can certainly teach the concept and encourage your child to try it, perhaps by giving up sweets or video games.This period of fasting is also a good time to show solidarity with people who do not have enough food. Take your child with you to donate to a food bank or serve meals at a shelter.For Roman Catholic children, the rules for fasting (before age 18) and meat abstinence (before age 14) typically dont apply;[1] the rules are more strict (and potentially variable) for Eastern Catholic and Eastern Orthodox[2] traditions.\n",
            "Encourage repentance.\n",
            "Teach your child that repenting for their sins will lead to a closer relationship with God. They may not understand the value of seeking forgiveness at first. However, by encouraging your child to admit to and apologize for their mischief (fighting with another child, saying bad words, sneaking candy), you can help them grow into a more mature person.Note how it usually feels better to come clean after withholding the truth or telling lies to cover up lies. This same feeling of relief and connection can happen when you admit your failings to God and ask for forgiveness.\n",
            "Teach your child about the significance of water.\n",
            "Water is fundamental to human life, but it also represents baptism and the washing away of sin. Place a symbol, such as a bottle of water, in your home, and encourage your child to think and talk about its importance.[3]Point out that, just as plain water can cleanse the body, Jesus is the living water that can cleanse the soul.\n",
            "Emphasize maintaining a close relationship with God.\n",
            "Christians eternal lives depend on what they believe and do now. The Lord inspires people to have faith, and expects them to be good to themselves and others. Its easy to forget about that, but Lent serves as a reminder.Suggest that your child think about Lent as a way to get closer to God. Point out that Jesus used his forty days to get away from distractions and commune with God.  They too can benefit from Lent by pushing aside at least some of the distractions of the world.\n",
            "Give thanks together for your blessings.\n",
            "You dont have to lecture your child on the subject, but definitely mention, in a natural way, that you both have certain luxuries that others do not. Remind your child that no one should take luxuries for granted.Note that your family can give up some non-essentials during Lent because all of you have been so blessed by God  and that you can honor God by giving to those in need.\n",
            "Teach by example.\n",
            "Respect the meaning of Lent yourself and be a good role model for your child. Embrace the rituals you espouse and try to make Lent a period of closeness and reflection for the whole family.Practice what you preach. If you expect your child to sacrifice something meaningful, you need to do the same. For example, if he or she is giving up toys, you can give up social media and computer games.\n",
            "Make spirituality a family affair.\n",
            "Read the Bible, pray, and talk about Christianity with your child. Find books about Jesus, Lent, and Easter that are written for children, and make the concepts interesting for your child. Consider, for example, acting out key events like the Last Supper or the empty tomb on Easter morning.Encourage your child to make something. As a family, use your hands to craft crosses, crowns of thorns, and other symbolic projects. Paint and decorate Easter eggs together. For inspiration, search for resources online.\n",
            "Prepare Lenten meals together.\n",
            "Fasting does not have to mean tasteless, unappealing food. Prepare something your child likes in order to encourage acceptance of Lents symbols and rituals. If they can help you out with the prep or cooking, all the better.Look for recipes online  you can find options ranging from tuna casseroles to salmon cakes [4] to veggie hoagies.[5]And dont forget about symbolic Lenten treats like soft pretzels and hot cross buns!\n",
            "Encourage your child to help others.\n",
            "Let your child decide on an act of kindness and who they would like to perform it for. Giving your child an active role will increase their enthusiasm and the acts impact upon them.For instance, maybe you have a shut-in, elderly neighbor.  A younger child could decorate a card, color eggs, and help you prepare some Easter-themed treats to bring over for a visit.  An older kid might help clean up their yard and plant some spring flowers.Let them know that giving to others is even more Christ-like than giving up things yourself.[6]\n",
            "Make Lent seem beautiful and appealing.\n",
            "Dont present Lent as a period of suffering and sacrifice and pain; emphasize that it is a time of reflection and family moments. Teach the importance of enjoying life and the miracles of resurrection and life after death.Dont present Lent as: Lets take a month and a half to be sad that Jesus died; then we can celebrate his resurrection.Instead:  Lets take this time to slow down and focus on Jesus sacrifice for all of us, and to give thanks for the eternal glory it opened up to us.\n",
            "Do not simply return to your old ways after Easter.\n",
            "Teach yourself and your children that Lent is supposed to be about becoming better people. These values should last after the rituals of Lent are over.Keep bringing food to the homeless shelter.  Keep limiting the amount of time you spend on your smartphone.  Keep talking about, reading about, and thinking about Jesus.  Keep spending quality time together.\n",

            "Study the bodys meridians to understand the flow of energy.\n",
            "Acupressure is based on the idea that your bodys energy, known as chi, flows along certain pathways in the body, called meridians, and that stimulating pressure points along these meridians will balance your chi.[2]There are 12 primary meridians running throughout the body  6 in the arms, and 6 in the legs. To learn more about these, visit https://www.amcollege.edu/blog/what-are-meridians-in-traditional-chinese-medicine-tcm.Although there is no physiological proof that these meridians exist, they seem to follow the paths of nerves throughout the body. For example, the lung meridian, often referred to as L, connects the lungs and intestines to nerves in the wrist (acupressure point L7) and the back of the hand (acupressure point L14).[3]The stomach median, referred to as S, starts in the brain and runs down into the foot, and contains acupressure points S36 and S37, which are just below the knee.\n",

This will remove the dried-out portions from older cuts.[3]You may need to score the tough outer edge of the stalk by cutting or gently sawing a few millimeters in all the way around the stalk, then breaking it along the scoring, rather than trying to chop all the way through.You may need to cut more from each end if the ends have become very hard and dried and you cannot access the juicier flesh.\n",

Score and break or chop through the stalk to make pieces of about six inches.It will be easiest to cut through sections of the stalk in between the thicker joints. Keep in mind, however, that the sections between the joints will also be the easiest to chew or use for other purposes, so its best to keep them intact.You can also cut the stalk lengthwise into two, four, or more thinner sticks for consumption. Do this before cutting off the outer layer, or afterwards if its easier to do so.\n",

            "Stick a small piece of the peeled sugar cane into your mouth to chew. Biting the fibrous inner flesh, called bagasse, will release the sweet flavor.[5]You can also try squeezing or muddling the stalk to release the sweet juice of the plant, but it may be difficult to do so, or to collect the resulting juice for consumption.Once you have chewed the fibrous material and extracted all of its sweetness, spit it out and dispose of it.\n",

            "Try using a thin section of the peeled stalk as a skewer for fruits, meats, etc. This can impart the sweet flavor of the sugar cane into other foods.Cut sugar cane pieces into thin sticks with a sharp point on one or both ends for optimal use as a skewer. You can leave the bark on for greater strength when skewering tougher foods.Use skewers for dessert items, like fruit kebabs or to dip strawberries in chocolate. Or freeze the skewers to more easily stick them into fish and meats for cooking or grilling the sweet flavor into proteins.\n",
            "Try the cane as a swizzle stick.\n",
            "Use the peeled sugar cane as a swizzle stick in any sort of beverage. This can give alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages a natural sweetness.Try dropping a stick into unsweetened tea. You can leave it in hot or iced tea for a few minutes to extract the sweetness, or just enjoy the gradual sweetening of the stick stirred in over time.Use a sugar cane swizzle stick in a rum-based cocktail like a mojito or planters punch for a gentle sweetener.\n",

            "How to Tell if Your Cat Has FIV: 13 Steps (with Pictures)\n",
            "Be aware that the symptoms of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) may not present themselves for several months after infection occurs.\n",
            "FIV is a slow worker - once your cat acquires the infection (usually through fighting), the presence of the virus is not made evident until 2 to 6 months after the initial infection.At the time of the fight, the cat may have punctures, scratches, and possibly an abscess from bacterial infection, but the FIV will not make him ill at this early stage.\n",
            "Look for transient symptoms of infection.\n",
            "It will only be 2 to 6 months after contracting the virus that the cat will begin to show transient symptoms such as fever, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, and appetite loss. These symptoms will pass after a week or two.This phase coincides with the virus multiplying in the blood stream, which is known as the viraemic phase.Once this phase subsides, the cat will return to full health and can remain apparently healthy for months, or even years, before the FIV makes him ill again.\n",
            "Understand that the secondary phase of infection has its own symptoms.\n",
            "In the secondary phase of infection, illness is caused by the virus gradually attacking the white cells used to fight off infection.As a result, the cat's immune system is weakened and simple infections may run out of control.This is known as the secondary phase of FIV. It can be identified by the list of symptoms described below.\n",
            "Look for signs of stomatitis and gingivitis.\n",
            "Even in full health, a cat's mouth is full of bacteria. However, without a healthy immune system to hold them in check, the bacteria start to multiply, resulting in an inflamed mouth (stomatitis) and/or sore gums (gingivitis).\n",
            "Monitor your cat for signs of rhinitis.\n",
            "Rhinitis refers to the infection of the nasal passages. The nose acts as a filter for bacteria in the air. When the immune system is weak, it allows opportunistic bacterial invaders to set up infection in the nasal chambers.Chest infections can also occur during this secondary phase of infection. This occurs as part of a similar process to rhinitis, where inhaled bacteria grow out of control.\n",
            "Check your cat for fungal infections.\n",
            "Fungi are all around us in the environment. This is not usually a problem because the immune system polices the skin and stops fungal infections from taking hold.However, a compromised immune system means conditions like ringworm and fungal infections can more easily get a grip.Poor skin immunity also allows the normal bacteria on the skin's surface to grow out of control and set up bacterial infections.\n",
            "Pay attention if your cat develops diarrhea.\n",
            "During the secondary phase of FIV infection, the bacterial balance within the cat's gut is not kept in check. This causes bacterial overgrowth which can lead to diarrhea.\n",
            "Look for signs that your cat has developed other medical conditions.\n",
            "When a cat has been infected with FIV, viruses which don't normally cause a problem may take advantage of their weakened immune system, causing secondary infections, such as cowpox. Cowpox causes inflamed, ulcerated sores on the skin.\n",
            "Call your vet to set up an in-house ELISA test for your sick cat.\n",
            "If your cat is ill and the vet suspects FIV, the first test will be an in-house ELISA test. The vet will draw about 1 milliliter (0.03floz) of blood from the cat, then send if off to the lab for testing. The results are usually back within 15 minutes.If the test is negative but the cat has a history suggestive of FIV exposure, a second test should be run 6 weeks later.Only if this second test is also negative can the vet definitely say the cat does not have FIV.\n",
            "Ask your vet to send your cat's blood for a PCR test.\n",
            "If the ELISA test comes back positive, then you can ask your cat's vet to send your cat's blood for a PCR test. This test is done at an external laboratory and can take up to a week to get the results back. PCR tests detect tiny amounts of viral DNA in the cat's blood. A positive test means the cat has the FIV virus in his blood stream.Due to the risk of false positives from the ELISA test, a positive result from this test should be confirmed via another type of test as a fail-safe. Most vets send the blood sample to a commercial laboratory for a PCR test, which looks for fragments of viral DNA.If this is positive, then sadly the cat has FIV. If the PCR test is negative, it is possible your cat is fighting off the infection. In this circumstance a repeat ELISA test in 6-weeks' time should come back negative, meaning your cat was exposed to the FIV but his immune system fought it and won.\n",
            "Understand the diagnosis process.\n",
            "Diagnosing FIV is a complex process, but in summary the following combination of test results indicate that a cat is actively infected with FIV and may become ill as a result in the future. Any one of the following indicates active infection:A single ELISA test positive result, followed by a PCR positive resultTwo ELISA positive results, confirmed by a PCR positive result.A positive PCR result.\n",
            "Realize that a healthy cat with FIV may remain healthy for years.\n",
            "A cat that is well at the time of diagnosis may stay in good health for years and years.Even if your cat is healthy, however, it's important to keep in mind that FIV weakens the body's immune system. This means your cat will be more vulnerable to developing complications with routine infections. However, prompt treatment with antibiotics at the first sign of sickness is usually sufficient to prevent this.More and more FIV positive cats are living into old age, and frequently FIV cats do not die from their infection but from other causes - including old age!\n",
            "Talk to your vet about the chances of recovery.\n",
            "You took to your cat to the vet because he was ill and the vet saw symptoms of FIV. If he is not responding as expected to treatment, then your cat's future is less certain. If he already has complications, such a pneumonia, then these secondary infections could easily overwhelm his immune system.Talk to your vet about his chances of recovery. You cat may have a chance with supportive care (intravenous fluids and antibiotics), but if he has developed serious issues (such a complete depletion of his white cell reserves) then he may already have permanent damage and not be able to win this fight.\n",

According to researchers, self-compassion involves three elements:Self-kindness. Were sometimes taught that being accepting and understanding toward ourselves is selfish or narcissistic, but think about it: if a friend made a mistake, would you constantly remind them of how horrible they are, or would you try to be understanding of their error? Extend yourself the same kindness you would to others.Common humanity.

Understanding that youre not the only person to make mistakes or feel hurt can help you feel more connected to those around you.Mindfulness. Mindfulness has a lot in common with meditation: its the idea of recognizing and accepting an experience, without judgment, as you experience it. For example, if you frequently have the thought, Im so unattractive, nobody will love me, a mindfulness approach might be something like, Im experiencing the feeling that Im unattractive. This is just one of many feelings that I will have today. Recognizing when you are having negative thoughts will help you move your thoughts elsewhere.\n",
            "Understand some myths about self-compassion.\n",
            "We are often taught that accepting ourselves is self-indulgent or egocentric, or -- worse yet -- lazy. Instead, we are told that perfectionism and self-criticism are healthy and productive. In fact, theyre not; they are usually based in fear.[1]Self-pity is different from self-compassion. Self-pity is the feeling of poor me that you may experience when things dont go your way; for example, My colleague got more of the credit for our project than I did. Nothing ever works out for me. Self-pity focuses only on your problems and often creates feelings of inadequacy. A self-compassionate thought might be, My colleague and I worked hard on that project, and I feel that I did a good job. I cant control how others respond to our work.Self-compassion isnt laziness. Accepting yourself doesnt mean that you dont want to improve yourself. It just means that you wont be cruel to yourself when you make mistakes. Practicing expressing love for yourself also helps you express it to others.Beating yourself up is not the same as accepting responsibility for your mistakes. A self-compassionate person can still own up to mistakes they make without feeling that he or she is a terrible person. Research has shown that self-compassionate people are actually more likely to attempt self-improvement.[2]\n",
            "Understand the difference between self-compassion and self-esteem.\n",
            "While these two sound similar, they have some crucial differences. Self-esteem is what you think and how you feel about yourself, and its important to being a healthy, happy person. However, it tends to be motivated by external validation: for example, you may feel attractive because someone compliments your looks. Self-compassion is about accepting yourself, flaws and all, and treating yourself with kindness and understanding.[3]Psychology research has shown that self-esteem is not a reliable indicator of success or even capability. Sometimes, its the most confident people who know the least about a situation.\n",
            "Reject shame.\n",
            "Shame is the source of a lot of pain, and were very good at producing it. Shame is the profound, enduring belief that somehow, we arent worthy: of love, of time, of attention. However, shame is often not related to anything that is actually wrong with ourselves or our actions; its an internal judgment. [4]Try to be aware of your thoughts and feelings about yourself. Sometimes shame manifests itself as feeling that you dont deserve love. Sometimes it presents itself as a fear that if we reveal our true selves, the other person will leave us. These feelings are common, but they are also very damaging. Try affirming to yourself that you do deserve love.\n",
            "Practice self-acceptance.\n",
            "This doesnt come naturally to most people, because were often trained to see criticizing ourselves as something positive (for example, it drives one to work harder, improve oneself, etc.). However, there are steps you can take to work on improving your ability to accept yourself.Point out your strengths to yourself. Were used to making lists of failures, and humans tend to remember negative events and emotions more clearly than positive ones.[5] Take some time each day to write down something positive about yourself. It doesnt matter so much if you believe it at first. Make a habit of thinking about yourself in positive terms, and youll probably become less resistant to believing them.Depersonalize your failures. It can be easy to think Im a failure if you havent succeeded at something, but that kind of totalizing thinking devalues you and promotes feelings of shame. Instead, try thinking something like, I didnt succeed at _____, but I did the best I could.Remind yourself that youre human. Perfectionism can have devastating consequences on the way we view ourselves. Try looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself: I am a human being. Human beings are not perfect, and neither am I. That is okay.\n",
            "Understand that vulnerability, weakness, and mistakes are part of the human experience.\n",
            "Sometimes, you will do something that you didnt want to do. Perhaps you scored badly on a test, or hurt a friends feelings, or lost your temper with your boss. However, dwelling on those negative occurrences and shaming yourself about them keeps you from viewing them as learning experiences.[6]Instead, accept that whatever happened happened, apologize for it if you can, and come up with a plan of what you will do differently in the future.Accepting your mistakes doesnt mean pretending they didnt happen. It doesnt even mean not feeling bad that they happened. Taking responsibility for your actions acknowledges the mistakes, but focusing on what you can learn from them and how you can avoid them in the future transforms guilt into growth.\n",
            "Understand where your hesitation to accept love comes from.\n",
            "People have many reasons for not being comfortable accepting love from others. For some, its just a trait of their personality that theyd like to change. For others, a history of abuse or trauma may have required that the person shut down to protect themselves, making trusting someone else enough to accept their love nearly impossible. Understanding why you are having trouble accepting love will help you overcome that difficulty.Some people are naturally more reserved than others. Dont confuse emotional reserve with inability to accept or express love.If you have previously been in relationships that ended badly, or if you were in a relationship with someone who didnt offer you the same love and trust that you offered them, it can be hard to think about accepting love again.It is natural for survivors of abuse to experience an inability to trust others. Trust is a difficult thing to re-learn, so take your time. Dont feel guilty because you have trouble trusting people.\n",
            "Become comfortable with vulnerability.\n",
            "In order to achieve intimacy in relationships, whether they are with friends or with romantic partners, you need to be comfortable being vulnerable with the other person. It can be terrifying to accept this possibility, but researchers emphasize that without vulnerability human connection cannot happen.[7]For example, much of what drives a classic fear of commitment is the fear of being vulnerable and then being hurt. This often stems from a history of past experiences.[8]You can practice accepting vulnerability incrementally. Start with small gestures -- greeting a coworker, saying hello to a neighbor -- and accept that they may not be returned and that this is okay. You just need to practice putting yourself forward.\n",
            "Assess the level of vulnerability you are comfortable with.\n",
            "Especially if you havent had a lot of practice in accepting love from others, or if youve been hurt by loved ones in the past, you may need to take particular care in choosing what love youre willing to accept and what level of vulnerability you are able to handle at this point in time.For example, accepting an offer to go out for coffee with a coworker may represent a fairly low level of vulnerability for some people, but a high level for others. Deciding to try healing a friendship that fell apart represents a very high level of vulnerability.You may need to start with small steps at first. Thats okay. You can build up to accepting greater levels of vulnerability as you become more comfortable with accepting love.\n",
            "Give up the need to control.\n",
            "Being in a relationship with another person, whether its a colleague, a friend, or a romantic partner, means that you are connecting with unique person with feelings and thoughts of his or her own. You cannot, and should not, control other peoples actions and emotions, and trying to do so can end up hurting everyone in the relationship. Accepting that you cant control the other person means accepting the possibility that they may hurt you, but it also means that you may find out how truly loving they can be when allowed to express themselves.[9]\n",
            "Find people who accept you as you are.\n",
            "Accepting yourself can be hard if the people you surround yourself with are constantly criticizing you or asking you to change. It will be much easier to accept love from friends and romantic partners who accept you for who you are, do not constantly criticize or shame you, and do not set conditions on their love for you.That said, however, a true friend will do their best to steer you away from destructive behavior. Be careful not to confuse \"my friends love me just the way I am\" with \"my friends let me get away with anything\".\n",
            "Embrace your right to say no.\n",
            "While many studies show that individuals who are open to vulnerability and accepting love from others tend to be happier and healthier people, you are not required to accept love from everyone. Always remember that you can and should ask others to respect your boundaries.The other person should respect the boundaries you set. People who routinely ignore or reject your requests may not be genuinely interested in your feelings.\n",
            "Learn to recognize when love is actually emotional abuse.\n",
            "Sometimes, individuals attempt to control other people by manipulating their feelings of love. There are many forms that emotional abuse can take, but learning to recognize these warning signs will help you determine when the offer of love is something that will enrich your life and when its an attempt to manipulate you.[10]A common abusive tactic is to make love conditional based on something that you do. This can manifest as manipulations such as If you really loved me you would. or I love you, butAnother abusive tactic is to threaten the withdrawal of love to get a desired behavior; for example, If you dont do ____, I wont love you anymore.Abusers may also play on your own insecurities to convince you to obey them, such as telling you that nobody will love you the way I do or nobody will want you if I leave you.If you experience any of these in your relationship, consider seeking counseling or other assistance. Emotional abuse is not normal, and you dont deserve it.Reader Poll: We asked 359 wikiHow readers what makes them feel like love is conditional, and 53% of them agreed that a common sign is feeling like theyre never good enough for their partner. [Take Poll] While conditional love isnt always abuse, your partner should never make you feel unworthy of being with them.\n",

            "Select your ammo.\n",
            "Round, dense objects will work best. Marbles or ball bearings are ideal. Avoid using stones. The object should be round so it shoots straight.Marbles are among the cheapest ammo choice, and the bright colors will make it easier to track your shot.\n",
            "Load your ammo.\n",
            "Hold the base with your dominate hand. With the opposite hand, place the ammo in the center of the pouch. Do not let the ammo shift away from the center of the band.\n",
            "Hold the ammo in place with your fingers.\n",
            "Use your thumb and index finger to keep the ammo in place. Your thumb should be parallel with the strap. You can curl your index finger slightly and press the other side of the pocket between your first and second knuckles.Avoid squeezing the pocket closed around the ammo. There should be enough space for the shot to release cleanly.\n",
            "Grip the slingshot by the base.\n",
            "Usually, you will want to grip the slingshot handle with your dominant arm and use your other arm to pull back the ammo. When you shoot, your arm may allow the slingshot to jerk forward slightly. This can throw off your accuracy. Your stronger arm will be more adept at keeping the slingshot steady when you release the shot.\n",
            "Hold the slingshot vertically or horizontally.\n",
            "Raise your arm to the side and hold up the slingshot. Some shooters prefer to hold the slingshot so that the forks are pointed upward, and some like to angle the forks slightly to the side. Either position works, and both can be useful depending on the shot you are taking.Not all slingshots are the same. Some have longer forks, or and some forks will be wider or narrower than others. You may have to adjust your grip based on the form of your slingshot as well.\n",
            "Turn your body sideways.\n",
            "The shoulder of the arm that will hold the grip of the slingshot should face your target. Raise the slingshot so it is perpendicular to your body, and slightly angled away from your body. This positioning will provide ample room for you to use your other arm and draw the slingshot band all the way back.\n",
            "Form a solid base with your legs.\n",
            "Keep your feet facing forward and even with the width of your shoulders. Keeping your feet too close together will make it harder to keep perfect balance and aim your shot accurately.\n",
            "Line up your shot.\n",
            "Take your time. Aim slightly above your target. You can angle your head slightly toward the slingshot to check your aim, but be sure to keep your head clear of the ammo.Try to use both eyes. Many shooters tend to rely on their dominant eye when aiming and close the other. While visual restrictions make this necessary, you will find you perform better when you practice using both eyes to find your target.\n",
            "Pull the ammo back with your free hand.\n",
            "Pull until the band is completely stretched out. Make sure you see all of the triangle formed by the forks of the slingshot.\n",
            "Exhale.\n",
            "Breathing is a big part of making accurate shots. Draw a breath into your lungs, release the breath completely, then take the shot. This will eliminate any chance that your slight body movements caused by breathing could mess up your shot. Take your shot during the body's NRP, or natural respiratory pause.[1]\n",
            "Release the band.\n",
            "Make one last check to make sure there is nothing that you might accidentally hit with your shot. Then let go of the ammo and watch it fly.Try to flick your wrist forward slightly after letting go of the ammo for a better shot.Make sure your thumb is not in the way of the projectile as it leaves the sling. This can be very painful!\n",
            "Adjust the bands to increase or decrease range.\n",
            "You can adjust the bands by creating more or less length in the bands. You will likely need to loosen the band from the attachment. Slide the band to create the right length, then tighten the bands again.If the band is at full length and the ammo is still not going far enough, consider trying a band made from a different material. Flat bands usually generate more power, but they can wear out much faster than the common nylon tube material.\n",
            "Replace the bands if they break.\n",
            "If the band breaks, you can usually contact the manufacturer to get a replacement. Be sure to check how easy it is to replace and adjust the bands when you select your slingshot.There are many different ways to attach the band to the base and some are easier and more secure than others. Ideally, you should select an attachment made of rubber or even string, as there is minimal risk of injury if the attachment breaks loose.\n",
            "Check the forks if you accidentally clip the base with your ammo.\n",
            "Make sure there are not any cracks in the material that could affect the performance of the slingshot. You don't want to have the piece suddenly snap off when you go to pull the band back. It can cause serious injury.If you have damaged the base significantly you will likely need to replace it.\n",

            "Use the thicker contour lines to determine the elevation.\n",
            "Contour lines represent paths or segments of the Earth. Topographic maps are covered in contour lines. Some contour lines are thicker, known as indexed contour lines. They have a number next to them that shows you the elevation of that path or segment.[1]For example, you may notice there is the number 6500 next to the thicker contour line. This means that everything along that line is 6,500 feet (2,000m) above sea level.There are also thin contour lines on the map. These are called intermediate contour lines and are not given an elevation.\n",
            "Determine the elevation change by looking at the space between the contour lines.\n",
            "The closer the spaces are between the contour lines, the more rapid the change in elevation. An area with contour lines that are spaced far apart have a fairly low elevation and be easy to hike or walk through. An area with a concentration of contour lines that are very close together have rapid changes in elevation. It has high and low terrain that may be more challenging to walk or hike through.[2]Vertical cliffs are notated by a series of contour lines that are drawn very close together. In some cases, cliffs that are very vertical and high may have contour lines that form a single line.\n",
            "Notice how the contour lines slope on the map.\n",
            "The way the contour lines curve can tell you if the path is going to be gentle or steep. A thick contour line that has rounded curves means the path is going to have a gentle slope that is easy to climb. A thick contour line with jagged curves that appear sharp means the path is going to have steep slopes that are harder to climb.Use the shape of the contour lines, as well as the space between the contour lines, to help you determine if the path is going to be easy or difficult to hike or climb on foot.\n",
            "Look for flat terrain with a dashed contour line.\n",
            "You may notice dashed lines on the map, which are called supplementary contour lines. This indicates the elevation is half of the elevation between the contour lines around it. This indicates the terrain is flat for a long expanse, or there is very little change in elevation in these areas.[3]\n",
            "Check for contour lines that form a circle.\n",
            "Contour lines that form a series of circles on the map, where the circles get smaller and smaller, indicate a raised land mass. If the contour lines are not thick and they form a circle, this means there is a hill. If the contour lines are thicker and form a circle, this means there is a summit or peak.There is usually an elevation number next to the land mass so you know how high above sea level it is. For example, if you see circular contour lines and the number 5400, this means the land mass is 5,400 feet (2,000m) above sea level.\n",

            "How to Learn Dutch (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Understand how the Dutch language developed.\n",
            "Dutch is classified as a West Germanic language which is closely related to other languages in this branch, including German, English and West Frisian.[1]The Dutch language originally developed from the Lower Franconian dialect of Low German. However modern Dutch has departed from its German origins in that it did not undergo the High German consonant shift and does not use the German umlaut as a grammatical marker.In addition, Dutch has more or less abandoned its original grammatical case system and has leveled a lot of its morphology. [2]On the other hand, Dutch vocabulary is primarily Germanic in origin (although it contains more Romance loan words) and uses the same word order in sentences (SVO in main clauses and SOV in subordinate clauses).[3]\n",
            "Know where Dutch is spoken.\n",
            "Dutch is spoken as a first language by approximately 20 million people, mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is spoken as a second language by approximately another 5 million.[4]In addition to The Netherlands and Belgium, Dutch is also used in parts of Northern France, Germany, Suriname and Indonesia and is an official language on the Caribbean islands of The Netherland Antilles.The dialects of Dutch spoken in Belgium are known collectively as Flemish. Flemish differs from standard Dutch in several ways, including pronunciation, vocabulary and intonation.The language of Afrikaans -- which is spoken in South Africa and Namibia by approximately 10 million people -- is a descendant of Dutch and the two languages are considered mutually intelligible.[5]\n",
            "Start with the alphabet and pronunciation.\n",
            "When beginning to learn any language, the alphabet is a good place to start.[6]A (ah) B (bay) C (say) D (day) E (ay) F (eff) G (khay) H (hah) I (ee) J (yay) K (kah) L (ell) M (emm) N (enn) O (oh) P (pay) Q (kew) R (air) S (ess) T (tay) U (ew) V (vay) W (way) X (eeks) Y (ee-grek or 'I') Z (zed).However, in terms of actual pronunciation, Dutch contains many sounds which are not used in English and can therefore be difficult to learn. The only letters which have the same pronunciation in Dutch as in English are the consonants s, f, h, b, d, z, l, m, n,  ng. The letters p, t, and k are formed in the same way, but they are not aspirated (there is no puff of air when they are spoken).The best way to learn the pronunciation of some of the more unusual consonant and vowel sounds is to listen to them and repeat. The following overview is not exhaustive, but it will help you to get started:Vowels: a (pronounced like \"ah\" in \"calm\", but shorter), e (pronounced like \"eh\" in \"bed\"),  i (pronounced like \"ih\" in \"bit\"), o (pronounced like \"aw\" in \"paw\", but with rounded lips), oe (pronounced like the \"oo\" in \"too\" but shorter), u (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"upset\", or \"ir\" in \"dirt\") and y (pronounced like the \"i\" in \"pin\" or \"ee\" in \"deep\", but shorter).Consonants: Some consonant sounds that are pronounced very differently in Dutch are ch, sch and g which all produce a guttural sound in the back of the throat (almost like the \"ch\" in the Scottish word \"loch\"). The Dutch r can be rolled or guttural, while the j is pronounced like the \"y\" in \"yes\". [7]\n",
            "Understand Dutch noun genders.\n",
            "The Dutch language classifies all of its nouns into one of two genders -- common (de words) or neuter (het words). This is much less complicated than German , which has three.[8]It can be difficult to guess which gender a word is based on how it looks. Therefore, it's better to just memorize the gender of specific words as you learn them.The common gender is actually a combined form of the masculine and feminine genders, which are no longer used. As a result, about 2/3 of all nouns belong to the common gender.Therefore, a good technique is just to learn all of the neuter nouns. Then you can be confident that any of the nouns you haven't learned are most likely common.You can identify neuter nouns by learning a number of rules. For example, all diminutive nouns (which end in je) and all infinitives that are used as nouns are neuter. This is also true for words that end in -um, -aat, -sel and -isme, and for most words that start with ge-, be- and ver-. The words for colors, compass directions and metals are also always neuter.\n",
            "Learn some of the most common present tense verbs.\n",
            "As you progress on your journey towards learning Dutch, it is a good idea to memorize some of the most commonly used present tense verbs as they are necessary to start forming sentences.Zijn: Present tense of \"to be\", pronounced \"zayn\".Ik ben: I am (pronounced \"ik ben\")Jij/u bent: You are (pronounced \"yay / ew bent\")Hij/zij / het is: He/she/it is (pronounced \"hay/zay/ut is)Wij zijn: We are (pronounced \"vay zayn\")Jullie zijn: You are (pronounced \"yew-lee zayn\")Zij zijn: They are (pronounced \"zay zayn\")Hebben: Present tense of \"to have\", pronounced \"heh-buhn\".\tIk heb: I have (pronounced \"ik hep\")Jij/u hebt: You have (pronounced \"yay/ew hept\")Hij/zij/het heeft: He/she/it has (pronounced \"hay/zay/ut hayft\")Wij hebben: We have (pronounced \"vay heh-buhn)Jullie hebben: You have (pronounced \"yew-lee heh-buhn\")Zij hebben: They have (pronounced \"zay heh-buhn\")[7]\n",

            "How to Learn Through Observation: 9 Steps (with Pictures)\n",
            "Watch and pay attention.\n",
            "Your first step in learning through observation is actually watching and paying attention to whatever youve focused on. Without committing your full attention, you wont be able to understand and internalize what youre observing.[1]Watch how others react to what youre observing. This can be a gauge to determine how effective they are depending on positive or negative responses.Avoid engaging in any other activities when observing. For example, put your smartphone away, turn off music, and dont chat with the people around you.Dont think about anything not related to whatever it is you are observing.\n",
            "Take notes.\n",
            "If possible, when you observe something, you should also take notes on whatever it is you are observing.[2] By taking notes, youll give yourself the ability to record both large and small details that have to do with whatever it is you are observing.[3]Use a journal to record your observations. For example, if you're observing someone teach, make notes about what they do. If the person you're observing verbally repeats what they're writing on a whiteboard, write that down. It may be a technique you'll want to mimic later.Write in shorthand, use abbreviations, or utilize some other sort of system so your notetaking will be efficient and will convey what you are observing.Type or re-type your notes later, this will help you retain the information you learned.[4]\n",
            "Observe again.\n",
            "After youve observed and taken notes, you should observe again, if possible. By observing again, youll gain a better understanding of whatever youre observing and youll be more likely to notice small details.[5]Watch for repetitions in their behavior, thinking patterns, or actions. Ask yourself why they may perform those actions repeatedly, since they are usually done for an important reason.The more you observe, the better. Every observation will help you learn more about whatever it is youre watching.\n",
            "Describe what you observed.\n",
            "An important step in reinforcing what youve learned is describing exactly what you observed. By describing what youve learned  either in writing or through words  youll help yourself better conceptualize what you saw.Write a short summary of what you observed. For instance, if you observed someone else teaching, you should write a summary of how they taught. Make sure to consult your notes when you write your summary.When writing your summary, consider writing something like \"Nancy gave the lesson while showing relevant pictures. She then passed out a handout and walked her students through the directions. Afterward, Nancy walked around the room answering questions and instructing as her students worked in groups.\"Talk to someone about what you observed. For instance, if you observed someone teaching, talk to that person about what you saw. Describe how they taught and the things they did that were effective.\n",
            "Reproduce what you observed.\n",
            "After youve described what you observed, its time for you to try to reproduce it. By reproducing what you observed, youll further reinforce what you learned. Fundamentally, by doing something, youll gain a much better understanding of it.[6]Make sure you have all the materials and resources that you need to reproduce whatever it is you observed. For example, if Nancy used an overhead projector, a whiteboard, and a handout, make sure you have those materials, too.Ensure that you have the proper time to reproduce what you saw.Try to see if the person you observed can be present when you reproduce what they did. That way, they can guide you along through the process. For example, if you observed someone teaching, see if they can sit in on your classroom for the day. [7]\n",
            "Instruct others.\n",
            "The final step in reinforcing what you learned through observation is to instruct others about whatever it is you observed.  By instructing others, youll further internalize and better conceptualize what you observed. This is because teaching is one of the best ways of learning.Create a structured and well-planned lesson about whatever it is you observed.Carefully explain, in steps, what you learned. For example, if youre instructing people how to teach, explain to them basic principles and steps involved in teaching.Answer any questions the people you are instructing might have.\n",
            "Read about different approaches toward observational learning.\n",
            "There are a wide variety of academic and popular books available that you can read to learn about observational learning. By reading about observational learning, youll learn about different techniques and perspectives about how to do so effectively.Consider the 1977 book Self-Efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change by Albert Bandura.Read Observational Learning: Evidence from Randomized Natural Field Experiment by Hongrin Cai, Yuyu Chen, and Hanming Fang.Consider Opening Doors to Equity: A Practical Guide to Observation-Based Professional Learning by Tonya Ward Singer. Singers book focuses on observation and learning in the education profession.\n",
            "Attend events where you can learn about observational learning.\n",
            "A great way to educate yourself about observational learning is to attend events where people will teach you or discuss different theories or methods about it. At such events, youll both learn by watching other people and by listening to them discuss their techniques.[8]Go to educational conferences. Depending on the conference, they might have panels or speakers that will address observational learning.See speakers in your area who speak on the subject.To find useful events, use an internet search engine to search for \"educational conferences\" or \"observational learning speakers.\" Scroll through the results to find events in your area.\n",
            "Enroll in relevant degree or non-degree granting programs that focus on related problems.\n",
            "The most formal way of educating yourself about observational learning is by relevant classes at your local college or university.[9]Consider classes on behaviorism, which focuses observing human behavior and drawing conclusions.Programs that might offer relevant classes include education, psychology, anthropology, sociology, and the sciences.\n",

            "Coat the wahoo lightly with olive oil.\n",
            "Set the wahoo fillets on a plate or tray and drizzle about  tablespoon (7.4ml) of olive oil over both pieces of fish. Use your hands or a kitchen brush to spread the olive oil on all sides of the wahoo so it doesnt stick to the pan.[1]Save the rest of your olive oil for coating the pan.You dont have to remove the skins from your wahoo fillets if theyre still attached. The skins are completely edible after you cook them.Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw fish so you dont spread any bacteria or foodborne illnesses.[2]\n",
            "Season your wahoo with salt and pepper.\n",
            "Take a pinch of salt and pepper and sprinkle it on your fish. Turn the pieces over and season each side of the fish so it has a consistent flavor throughout.[3]The amount of salt and pepper you use all depends on your personal preferences.You can use any spices or seasonings you want. Feel free to experiment and try out new flavors, such as paprika, red pepper flakes, or garlic![4]\n",
            "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.\n",
            "Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of olive oil to a non-stick skillet and put it on your stove. Turn the burner onto medium-high heat and let the oil warm up. Once the olive oil starts bubbling and rippling, its hot enough to start cooking your fish.[5]\n",
            "Lay the fish in the skillet and cover the pan.\n",
            "Slowly place the fillets in the pan with the meat side down if they still have the skin on. Otherwise, you can start cooking them on any side. Make sure the fish are spaced out around the pan so its not too overcrowded, or else they wont cook properly. Put a lid on the pan so the oil doesnt splatter.[6]Be careful when putting your wahoo in the pan since hot oil could bubble and land on your skin. Try to lay the skillets away from you so its less likely to splatter.\n",
            "Let the wahoo cook for 34 minutes.\n",
            "Dont touch or move the fillets at all since the pieces could break apart. Instead, leave them alone so the bottom sides of the fish cook through.[7]\n",
            "Flip the fish over and let it cook for another 3 minutes.\n",
            "Carefully slide a spatula underneath the fillet and gently turn it over to the other side. Put the lid back on the pan and leave your fish for another 3 minutes so it cooks through. As a rule of thumb, cook your fish for 3 minutes per side for every  inch (1.3cm) of thickness.[8]\n",
            "Check the fishs temperature to see if its above 145F (63C).\n",
            "Stick a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the fish and wait for the reading. If the temperature is at least 145F (63C), then youre finished cooking your fish. If its any lower, cook it for another 12 minutes before checking the temperature again.[9]Avoid eating raw or undercooked fish since it might give you a foodborne illness.\n",
            "Melt butter over each of the fillets if you want a richer flavor.\n",
            "If you really want to enhance the flavor of your fish, put  tablespoon (3.5 g) of unsalted butter on top of each fillet. Let the butter melt onto the meat so it can absorb the flavor. Wait for the butter to melt completely before serving your fish.[10]You dont have to put butter on your fish if you dont want to.\n",
            "Serve the fish with lemon and parsley.\n",
            "Immediately plate your wahoo and enjoy it while its still hot. If you want to bring out some of the other flavors, squeeze a lemon wedge on the fish to add a hint of citrus. You can also use fresh chopped parsley to add some more color to the dish.[11]Enjoy your fish with a refreshing side, such as a salad.If you have any leftovers, you can keep them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.[12]\n",
            "Preheat your oven to 350F (177C).\n",
            "Set one of your oven racks to the center position before you start. Let your oven warm up completely before you start cooking to ensure the wahoo reaches the right internal temperature.[13]\n",
            "Space the fillets out on a rimmed baking tray.\n",
            "Choose a baking tray that has a rim so nothing spills over the edge. Evenly space your pieces of fish on the tray so they arent overcrowded and cook thoroughly.[14]If you dont want as much of a mess to clean up when youre finished cooking, then cover it with a sheet of aluminum foil first.\n",
            "Top the fillets with lemon slices and lemon juice.\n",
            "Cut a thin slice of lemon for each piece of fish youre cooking. Place the slices on top of the fillets so the flavors can absorb into the meat while they cook. Squeeze the juice from whatever you have leftover from the lemon for an added hint of citrus to the meat.[15]If you dont have enough juice from the leftover piece of lemon, its okay to use another lemon or prepackaged lemon juice.\n",
            "Drizzle the wahoo with olive oil.\n",
            "Use a total of 12 tablespoons (1530ml) of olive oil for all of your wahoo fillets. Lightly pour the olive oil over the meat and use a kitchen brush to coat the other sides. Spread the oil into a thin layer over each piece of fish.[16]\n",
            "Sprinkle salt, pepper, and parsley over the fish.\n",
            "You can use fresh or dried parsley for your fish. Spread a total of 2 tablespoons (7.5 g) of parsley over the fillets. Then take a pinch of salt and pepper for each piece of fish and sprinkle it over the meat for seasoning.[17]You can use as little or as much salt and pepper you want. It all depends on how strong you want to season the fish. Only use a pinch at a time since it can be really easy to over-season.\n",
            "Cover the baking tray with foil and cook the fish for 1520 minutes.\n",
            "Rip a piece of aluminum foil thats large enough to wrap around the sides of the baking tray. Put the foil on top of the tray and fold the edges underneath. Put your tray of fish on the center rack of your oven and leave it alone while it cooks.[18]The foil will trap steam and make your fish cook faster.\n",
            "Combine chopped parsley, garlic, lemon zest, and salt to make an herbal garnish.\n",
            "While your fish is cooking, you have the perfect time to prepare a delicious gremolata, or garnish. Put 6 tablespoons (22.5 g) of chopped parsley, the zest of 1 lemon, 2 cloves of garlic, and a pinch of salt into a mixing bowl and stir it together. Make sure you thoroughly combine all the ingredients.[19]If you want the garnish to have a paste-like consistency, add 2 tablespoons (30ml) of olive oil.\n",
            "Test the fish to see if its over 145F (63C).\n",
            "Take your fish out of the oven and peel the foil off of the tray. Your fish should look opaque and flake apart easily if its finished, but still check the internal temperature to be sure. If the thickest part of the fillet is at least 145F (63C), then youre finished cooking.[20]If your wahoo isnt finished cooking, cover it and put it back in your oven for another 23 minutes.\n",
            "Serve the fish with a dollop of your garnish.\n",
            "Enjoy your fish right out of the oven so its hot. Take a spoonful of your garnish and place it on top of your fish right before you eat it so the flavors have a chance to infuse.[21]Store leftovers in an airtight container for 34 days in your fridge.[22]\n",
            "Warm up your grill to high heat.\n",
            "If youre using a gas or electric grill, turn the dial to high and let it warm up completely.[23] If youre using charcoal, set the grate about 4 inches (10cm) above the coals so theyre at the right heat. Let the coals burn completely before you start cooking.\n",
            "Combine butter, lime juice, lemon zest, paprika, salt, and pepper for a marinade.\n",
            "Wahoo is a delicate fish, so keep your marinade simple so you dont overpower the flavor. Melt 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter and add 2 tablespoons (30ml) of lime juice. Sprinkle in 1 teaspoon (2 g) of lemon zest,  tablespoon (4 g) of paprika,  teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and  teaspoon (0.6 g) of black pepper and whisk it together.You dont need to use a marinade if you dont want any additional flavors. Just be sure to spread oil on the grill grates before you cook so the wahoo doesnt stick to it.\n",
            "Cover your wahoo fillets with your marinade for 30 minutes.\n",
            "Set the meat on a lipped tray so you can carry it out to your grill. Use a kitchen brush to spread the marinade over your fillets. Make sure you coat the pieces evenly and let them sit for about 30 minutes so the flavor absorbs into the meat.[24]While some sources say to refrigerate the fish right before you cook it, it could cause the fish to cook unevenly or make it dry out. Leave it out at room temperature for about 15 minutes.[25]\n",
            "Grill the fish for 34 minutes on the first side.\n",
            "Lay your fillets on the grill and leave them alone while theyre cooking. Let the meat develop a char while it cooks for a classic grilled flavor.[26]It doesnt matter which side you start cooking your fish on.\n",
            "Flip the fillets and cook the other side for another 45 minutes.\n",
            "Once the first side finishes cooking, use a spatula to gently turn the fish over to the other side. Let your wahoo fillets cook undisturbed for around 5 minutes. Use a food thermometer in the thickest part of the fish to check if its reached at least 145F (63C). Otherwise, its not safe to eat.[27]Your wahoo fillets will look opaque and flaky when theyre finished.\n",
            "Serve the wahoo while its still hot.\n",
            "Take the wahoo off of your grill and eat them while theyre hot so you can enjoy their full flavor. Enjoy fresh greens or a salad as a side to pair with your fish.[28]You can keep leftover wahoo in your fridge for about 4 days before you need to throw it out.[29]\n",

            "Measure up from the floor to find where the cabinets will rest.\n",
            "Hold a level on the ground and against the wall to find the floors highest point. Measure up the wall about 48in (120cm) or in (50cm) above a lower cabinet. Mark this spot with a pencil and draw a straight line through it all the way across the wall.Use a ruler to trace any lines. You want to keep them as straight as possible since youll use them as references when hanging the cabinets.When youre finished tracing the line, you can use a level to check it.\n",
            "Outline where the 1st cabinet will hang.\n",
            "Using a tape measure, note the dimensions of the cabinets. The line you drew earlier represents their bottom edge. Measure up from it to sketch the cabinets height. Then, use the ruler to make a 2nd straight line all the way across the wall so you can keep the cabinets level later.[1]When hanging multiple cabinets, always start with the corner cabinet if there is 1. Otherwise, start with the leftmost cabinet.\n",
            "Mark the stud locations on the wall.\n",
            "The cabinets need to be screwed into the wood studs in the wall. The easiest way to find them is with a stud finder purchased from a home improvement store. Mark these spots in pencil so you know where to hang the cabinets.[2]Another way to find the studs is to knock on the wall. Youll hear a lower, fuller sound when hitting a stud instead of empty space.If you cant find the studs, you can do it by drilling partway into the wall about every 16in (41cm). Youll have to repair these spots with spackling or another substance before hanging the cabinets.\n",
            "Mark the length between studs on the cabinets backs.\n",
            "First, measure the length between the studs, then transfer this onto the cabinets. The cabinets will have a thick support rail on the top and bottom. There should be 1 mark on each of both rails.Some cabinets will have another one of these thick support rails in the middle that you should also mark.\n",
            "Hang a ledger board on the bottom line you traced.\n",
            "At the home improvement store, pick up a 1in 4in (2.5cm 10.2cm) ledger board or wall cleat. Line the boards top edge up with the bottom line you drew. Use in (3.2cm) drywall screws to secure it to the wall. This board ensures the cabinets are level upon installation.[3]If you have a friend who will hold the cabinets as you install them, you dont need a ledger board.Instead of a ledger board, you may also use a cabinet jack. Set the cabinet on the jack and raise the jack up so you can reach the cabinets while you work.\n",
            "Remove the doors from the cabinets.\n",
            "Removing the doors, along with any shelving or other extra features, makes the cabinets a lot lighter. Be sure to label the parts with tape after unscrewing them so you can reinstall them properly later.[4]\n",
            "Drill holes through the backs of the cabinets.\n",
            "Find the stud measurements you marked on the back of the cabinets. Drill all the way through them, making holes about 2in (5.1cm) wide. Make sure the holes are about in (1.9cm) from the cabinets edges.[5]\n",
            "Screw the cabinet to the wall.\n",
            "Start with the corner cabinet or leftmost cabinet if youre not installing in a corner. Rest the bottom of the cabinet on the ledger board. Line it up with the studs, then fasten it in place with 3in (7.6cm) cabinet screws in each hole.Its best to leave the screws a little loose until youve finished shimming the cabinet.\n",
            "Shim the cabinet until its level.\n",
            "Check over the cabinet for uneven spots. Slip shims behind the cabinets sides to raise them. Continue adding and adjusting these wooden strips until the cabinet is plumb.[6]Shims are small, wooden strips used for positioning. Theyre sold in packs at home improvement stores.You can test the cabinet with a level to make sure it looks perfect.\n",
            "Hang the second cabinet next to the first one.\n",
            "Secure 2 cabinets to the wall before trying to fasten them. First, get the cabinet as close to the first one as possible. Repeat what you did before, screwing the cabinet to the studs and shimming it until its level.\n",
            "Pre-drill holes from 1 cabinet to the other.\n",
            "Pick the cabinet where the screws will be least noticeable. The holes should be inside the cabinet on the front edge of  the frame. Make sure youre not drilling where the hinges lay. Drill a in (3.2mm) hole below the top hinge, then another hole above the lower hinge.Hold the cabinets together with a pair of clamps to ensure they stay level.\n",
            "Screw the cabinets together.\n",
            "Slide a in (6.4cm) screw into each hole. Use a cordless screwdriver to secure the cabinets together.

            "Cut a filler strip if theres a gap between the cabinet and wall.\n",
            "Spare filler strips or moulding can be purchased from a home improvement store. Lay masking tape over the strip, then pencil on the gap measurement either by using measuring tape or a scribing block. Cut the filler strip to size with a jigsaw.[9]Try to match the filler strips color and appearance to your cabinets. You may need to stain or paint it.\n",
            "Secure the strip to the cabinet with screws.\n",
            "Drill a pair of in (3.2mm) holes from the cabinets frame to the filler strip. Stick in (6.4cm) screws in the holes, then tighten them with a cordless screwdriver.Filler strips are placed beside the leftmost or rightmost cabinets, between the wall and cabinet. Keep in mind that it will be visible, so make sure it matches your cabinets.\n",
            "Remove the ledger from the wall.\n",
            "Make sure all the cabinets are tightly screwed to the wall first. Undo the screws in the ledger or wall cleat to remove it. The screws will leave holes that youll need to repair with spackling.\n",

            "How to Start Learning Shona - wikiHow\n",
            "Start with the 5 vowels.\n",
            "The Shona alphabet has 5 vowels, each of which are pronounced similarly to the same letters in the Spanish or Italian alphabets. If your first language is English, practice the vowel sounds, focusing on the ones that are pronounced differently in Shona than they are in English. Vowels are perhaps the most important part of the Shona language. Because Shona is a phonetic language, if you understand the vowel sounds, you'll be able to spell practically any word you hear. The letter \"A\" makes an \"ah\" sound, similar to the \"a\" in the English word \"father.\"The letter \"E\" makes an \"eh\" sound, similar to the \"ay\" in the English word \"say.\"The letter \"I\" makes an \"ee\" sound, similar to the \"ee\" in the English word \"see.\"The letter \"O\" makes an \"oh\" sound, similar to the \"o\" in the English word \"so.\"The letter \"U\" makes an \"oo\" sound, similar to the \"oo\" in the English word \"doom.\"\n",
            "Pronounce most consonants the same as you would in English.\n",
            "Shona uses the same alphabet as English, and almost all of the consonants are pronounced the same, with the exception of \"j,\" which is pronounced with a \"yah\" sound, similar to the Spanish \"j.\" However, Shona also has more breathy consonants that don't appear in English.[2]To pronounce a breathy consonant, breathe out a little, almost like a sigh, as you say the letter, similar to how you would pronounce the \"h\" in the English word \"behind.\"Breathy consonants in Shona are represented by an \"h\" after the initial consonant: \"bh,\" \"ch,\" \"dh,\" \"mh,\" and \"vh.\"Most Shona dialects, as well as \"Standard Shona,\" do not use the \"L\" sound, except in loan words.\n",
            "Practice consonant combinations.\n",
            "There are no silent letters or blended consonants in Shona. Rather, each consonant retains the same sound regardless of which letters appear around it. For this reason, some consonant combinations may be difficult for you to pronounce correctly.[3]For example, the combination \"dz\" might give you trouble, especially if your first language is English.The combinations \"zv\" and \"sv\" are properly pronounced with something like a whistle. This is a sound unique to the Shona language, and can also be difficult if you speak English or a European language as your first language. Listen to native speakers to get a better idea of how these combinations sound.[4]If you come across a word with a consonant combination that you have difficulty pronouncing, look online for a recording of a native speaker saying the word slowly. Practice saying the word, gradually speeding up your speech until you can pronounce it correctly.

            "Shona words only have one vowel per syllable and each syllable ends in a vowel. Therefore, you can use the presence of vowels to easily divide a word into syllables. For example, the word \"vakadzi\" means \"women\" in Shona. You can break this word down into 3 syllables: va-ka-dzi.All syllables carry the same stress in a Shona word, and the vowels always sound the same. Therefore, a word such as \"vakadzi\" would be pronounced \"vah-kah-dzee.\"\n",
            "Listen for tones that differentiate words.\n",
            "While Shona is not a completely tonal language, like Chinese, the language does use two tones  a high tone and a low tone. These two tones are used to differentiate words, typically two-syllable words, that mean something different depending on which tone pattern is used. For example, the word \"hama,\" spoken with two high tones, means \"relative.\" However, if you use a high tone with the first syllable and a low tone with the second syllable, the word means \"hammer.\"In longer words with 4 or more syllables, tones have less significance. While tones may be used with longer words, getting the tones wrong will seldom change the meaning of the word.\n",
            "Use \"mhoro\" as a general greeting.\n",
            "\"Mhoro\" means \"hello,\" and is a reasonably formal way of greeting people. This greeting is appropriate when greeting or acknowledging anyone, particularly if you've never met them before.[5]With people your age or younger, especially friends, you can also use \"hesi,\" which is a more casual way of saying \"hi.\"[6]\n",
            "Try different greetings based on the time of day.\n",
            "Just as in other languages, people often greet each other with reference to the time of day, especially if seeing each other for the first time. Some Shona greetings are:[7]Mangwanani: Good morning (reply: Mangwanani, marara sei?)Masikati: Good afternoon (reply: Masikati, master sei?)Manheru: Good evening (reply: Maswera sei?)\n",
            "Continue the conversation by asking \"Wakadini?\"\n",
            "The word \"wakadini\" means \"How are you?\" If you want to converse with someone you meet, say this immediately after saying \"mhoro.\" This is also considered polite if you're actually interacting with someone rather than simply acknowledging their presence.[8]The standard response to this question is \"ndakasimba, waita hako,\" which means \"I'm good, thanks.\" If you were the first person to ask, the person might also add \"ko iwe?\" which means \"And you?\"For example, if you're walking up to a counter at a restaurant to order food, you might say \"Mhoro, wakadini?\"\n",
            "Use the word \"ndinonzi\" to tell someone your name.\n",
            "After your greeting, it's polite to introduce yourself to someone if you plan to continue speaking to them. Say \"ndinonzi\" followed by your name. You don't have to worry about \"translating\" your name into Shona. Your name as it's pronounced in your language is fine.[9]After you introduce yourself, add \"Unozani?\" to ask them their name. When they tell you their name, you might say \"ndafara kukuziva,\" which means \"pleased to meet you.\"\n",
            "Ask basic questions to keep the conversation going.\n",
            "Perhaps the best way to keep a conversation going is to ask the person about themselves. If you're just beginning to learn Shona, it doesn't matter if you don't understand every word the person says  you can ask them about it later to get a better sense of what they're saying. Some good questions to ask are:[10]Une makore mangani? (How old are you?)Unobva kupi? (Where are you from?)Unogara kupi? (Where do you live?)Unoitei chinokuraramisa? (What do you do for a living?) Note that Zimbabweans consider it a point of pride to talk about their education and occupation, as these things are seen as a way to earn your respect.[11]\n",
            "Use polite words and phrases to show respect.\n",
            "Generally, people will be more helpful and willing to talk to you if you're well-mannered. Be gracious and respectful to Shona speakers by learning the following words and phrases:[12]Ndinokumbirawo (please)Waita zvako (thank you)Zvakanaka (reply to \"thank you\")Ndineurombo (sorry)Pamusoro (excuse me)\n",
            "Label items around your home with Shona words.\n",
            "Search online for vocabulary lists you can use for furniture and other items around your home. Write the Shona word on a sticky note and attach it to the item. Each time you pass the item, say the Shona word aloud.[13]With this method, you'll come to think of the labeled items by their Shona word after a while. Once you've committed one group of items to memory, move on to another group.\n",
            "Listen to Shona music.\n",
            "The rhythm, repetitive lyrics, and relatively simple themes of most songs allow you to become more familiar with the language in a way that's easy to remember. Traditional Shona music, called \"mbira,\" features interwoven rhythms and melodies with a lot of improvisation, similar to jazz music. iYou can listen for free online through YouTube and other websites.[14]On YouTube and music streaming services, you can also access current popular music in the Shona language.\n",
            "Chat online with native Shona speakers.\n",
            "Search online for language exchange platforms with native Shona speakers. Typically, you speak with Shona-speaking users on this platform in exchange for practicing with them a language they want to learn that you know.For example, if you speak English and Spanish, you might search for Shona speakers who want to learn either of those languages.Some platforms charge a subscription fee. However, most of them are free. Those which charge a subscription may offer additional options that aren't offered on free websites, such as the ability to have group chats or converse for longer periods of time.\n",

            "Listening to Zimbabwe radio stations, such as Radio Zim (https://www.radiozim.co.zw/), allows you to listen to Shona being spoken by native speakers as well as Shona-language music.Because you can listen to news, you may be able to pick up on what some of the words mean based on the context  particularly if they're discussing international events that you are already familiar with.\n",
            "Read about news and current events in Shona.\n",
            "Since Shona is a phonetic language, reading can help both your literacy and your speech, especially if you read articles aloud. Look online for news websites from Zimbabwe that are written in Shona.[15]Voice of America offers news stories written in Shona on https://www.voashona.com/z/3259.

            "Catch the football with soft hands.\n",
            "Soft hands are when your fingers and wrists are flexible and slightly relaxed. You want your hands to give a little bit when they come into contact with the ball. Catching with stiff, hard hands makes it more likely that the ball will bounce off you when you try to catch it.[4]\n",
            "Keep your arms extended away from your body.\n",
            "Whether you're catching a regular pass (above the waist) or a low pass (below the waist), you want your arms to be slightly bent and extended outward. Extending your arms will give them room to respond to the impact when you catch the ball.[5]\n",

            "Line them up with the trajectory of the football.[10]For example, if you see the football flying through the air at around the same level as your hips, move your hands down toward your hips so they're prepared to catch the ball.\n",
            "Turn your hands so your fingers are pointing down at the ground.\n",

Use multiple techniques, such as riffle or overhand shuffles, to ensure the cards are randomized. Then, ask another player to place a red cut card anywhere in the middle of the deck. Once they place it, split the deck so the red cut card is on the bottom of one of the stacks. Place the other stack on top to finish the shuffle.[1]The cut card is a solid red card placed in the deck that marks where the cards should be separated during the cut. It's not totally necessary, but it can be helpful when cutting the deck.If youre playing with a large group, you can combine up to 6 or 8 decks to change the odds of the game.\n",

Your reason may be as simple as wanting someone to look after your affairs while you are gone on an extended trip. Having a discussion with your loved ones can also jump-start the decision making process. Your loved ones may have suggestions as to the type of power of attorney you may need and the people that should be involved.if you are seeking to be an \"agent,\" the person receiving authority from the \"principal,\" the person giving their authority to the agent, talk to the principal regarding your motives and intentions.[1]\n",

            "Once you determine that a power of attorney is right for you, you will need to decide what type of power of attorney to create. In California, the first type of power of attorney is a durable power of attorney. A durable power of attorney allows you to act on behalf of another person for all day-to-day financial decision making. This is the most flexible and permissive form of a power of attorney.A durable power of attorney survives even if the principal becomes incapacitated. In California, in order to create a durable power of attorney, you must include the following language:\"This Power of Attorney shall not be affected by subsequent incapacity of the principal\"; or\"This Power of Attorney shall become effective upon the incapacity of the principal\"; orAny other language that shows you want the power of attorney to remain in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated.A durable power of attorney can become effective whenever the principal so chooses. You can make it go into effect immediately or you can choose a time to make the power of attorney effective.A durable power of attorney terminates upon the death of the principal, or when the principal cancels it.

            "Choose someone you trust.\n",
            "When you appoint an agent, that person will have the ability to make various financial and medical decisions on your (the principal's) behalf. Because an agent has so much power, you want to be sure to choose someone you trust with your health and well-being. In addition, choose someone that understands your financial situation, as well as your medical concerns.\n",
            "Consider age, health, and location of potential agents.\n",
            "Remember that whoever you choose to appoint as your agent will be making important decisions, for potentially a long period of time, regarding your life. Consider someone's age, health, and location prior to making a decision.For example, if the agent does not live near you, it may be difficult for that person to have the required relationship with your banks or your doctors.\n",
            "Consider the agent's religion and lifestyle preferences.\n",
            "Make sure you choose someone with the same or similar beliefs as you. The goal in choosing an agent is to have that person make decisions for you in the same or similar manner as you would make them for yourself. Therefore, choose an agent who shares your medical and financial beliefs.For example, some people may not believe in keeping an individual on life support for an extended period of time (for religious or personal reasons), while others may believe in doing so. Whatever your beliefs, choose someone that thinks similarly to you.\n",
            "Download an appropriate power of attorney form.\n",

In addition, the California Office of the Attorney General website provides a standard power of attorney for health care form.[9] Between these two forms, you should be able to create a valid power of attorney that addresses the concerns you have.\n",
            "Name the parties.\n",
            "When filling out either form, the first step will be two identify each party to the power of attorney. First, you will include the principal's name, address, and contact information. Next, you will need to include the name of the agent or agents that were chosen.If you designate more than one person to act as an agent, you will need to designate the way in which decisions will be made. If you want each agent to be able to act on their own, simply state that the agents can act separately. If you want all of your agents to act together, state that the agents must act jointly.\n",
            "Choose the powers you want the agent to have.\n",
            "Each form will have a section for you to check off powers you want the agent to have, and each form will provide space for you to write out clear directives.Using the California Probate Code form, you can grant powers by simply initialing next to the powers already laid out. In order to withhold powers, simply avoid initialing next to that power. The subjects included in the form are: real property transactions; tangible personal property transactions; stock and bond transactions; commodity and option transactions; banking and other financial institution transactions; business operating transactions; insurance and annuity transactions; estate, trust, and other beneficiary transactions; claims and litigation; personal and family maintenance; benefits from social security, medicare, medicaid, or other governmental programs, or civil or military service; retirement plan transactions; and tax matters.In the health care form, the agent will be authorized to make all health care decisions unless exceptions are explicitly provided.With the different types of powers of attorney in mind, you need to determine exactly what needs to be accomplished. Durable powers of attorney are often appropriate for long-term care of someone experiencing serious medical issues who is in danger of becoming incapacitated. Durable powers of attorney are also often granted to trust administrators and conservators so the trustee can manage the estate without having to seek signatures on every document.For most other situations, a general or limited power of attorney will suffice. Even if the power of attorney will be valid for a long period, such as a period of incarceration or until a child turns 18, you should only take or delegate as much authority as necessary.\n",
            "Note powers that cannot or will not be conferred.\n",
            "The final part of a power of attorney should include specific powers you do not wish to confer. You want to include these exclusions in order to make clear the limits of the agent's powers.For example, if you do not wish to allow the agent to make real property decisions, including the purchase and sale of real property, explicitly state this in your power of attorney.Also, there are some issues that cannot be legally included in a power of attorney. For example, in California, an agent cannot make or change the principal's will.\n",

            "In California, a power of attorney must either be acknowledged in front of a notary or signed by two witnesses.While either method of validation will work, consider doing both. By signing in front of a notary, you expel any doubt as to the validity of the principal's signature. Also, by having two witnesses sign the power of attorney, you are also creating parties who can testify as to the validity of the document.\n",
            "Maintain separate accounts and records.\n",
            "The agent must not co-mingle his personal funds and property with those of the principal. Keep separate bank accounts and meticulous records.\n",

            "The agent can withdraw from the power of attorney at any time by submitting written notice and an accounting of all property in his possession. If there is an alternate agent, authority will transfer immediately. If there is not alternate agent, the principal will need to execute a new power of attorney.The principal can terminate the power of attorney at any time either in writing or by executing a new power of attorney with a different agent.

For instance, if your partner gets off of work at 5 p.m. and you have a break in between your classes at the same time, set up a short call with them so you can talk while youre both free.Life happens and sometimes things come up that may interfere with your scheduled call with your partner.

            "Absence can make the heart grow fonder, but it can also make you miss someone even more! Talk about how much you love your partner. Mention some of the specific things that they do that you adore and that make you feel better.[3] It can help remove any doubt from each others minds and strengthen your emotional connection.[4]For instance, you could say, I always feel so much better after I talk to you. You know how to calm me down.You could also try, I love your sense of humor. You get me. Youre my best friend.\n",
            "Open communication is important for any relationship.\n",
            "[5] Whenever you do talk to your partner, dont withhold or hold anything back from them. Tell them about whats going on with you and your life. Talk about any negative feelings or emotions youve been having. They may be able to offer words of encouragement or advice, or they may just be a great listening ear to help you vent your frustrations.[6]If youre feeling like your emotional needs arent being met, talk to your partner about it. Dont try to bury your feelings down to try to make things work. Your partner may be able to help and give you what you need.[7]Talk to your partner about everything going on in your life! Make them feel special and try to make the distance disappear. Tell them about your annoying boss, your goofy friend, and the crazy dream you recently had. Make them feel included.Because you arent physically close to each other, sometimes words can be confused or misunderstood in a long-distance relationship. Ask for clarification if you arent sure you understand something your partner is telling you.\n",
            "It can help you and your partner feel closer.\n",
            "Tell them about the traffic you sat in on the way to work. Talk about how your coffee order was wrong or your lunch was cold. Bring up the random article or piece of trivia you read online that day. Include your partner in everything you can think of and ask them to do the same. Share each others worlds with each other and you may not feel like youre so far away from them.[8]Sure, the big events of your day may seem more exciting, but intimacy can also lie in the little details, too.\n",

            "Whether youre separated because of school, work, military service, or any other reason, you and your partner decided it was worth it. Whenever either (or both) of you are feeling down about being so far apart, talk about why youre doing it and how great itll be when youre finally reunited. Stay focused on the end date and it can help both of you stay close to each other.[9]For instance, you could say, I know its really hard right now, but once Im finished with school we can be together and live wherever we want.You could also try, I hate being away from you, but itll be over soon enough and itll be so worth it.\n",
            "Cook dinner, watch a movie, or just spend time together.\n",
            "Use technology to close the distance between you and your partner! Pick out a recipe, start a video call, and prop up your phone or computer on your counter so you can cook together. Choose a movie you both want to watch and start it at the same time while youre on a video call, or use a plug-in like Netflix Party or Google Watch Party so you can watch it together. Or just keep it simple: set up a video call and just enjoy each others company for the evening.[10]Try scheduling the date night a few days in advance to build anticipation and to give you both something to look forward to.With the use of video calls, theres really no shortage of romantic ideas for a virtual date! You could play video games together, have a happy hour, or even have a dance party of two.\n",

            "Gifts can actually help fill the space between you in a long-distance relationship and give you something tangible to hold and touch from your partner. Find something you think theyd like at a local shop or online. Mail it to them as a fun little surprise to brighten their day and show them that youre thinking of them.[11]For instance, if your partner collects rocks or crystals, you could mail them one to add to their collection. Every time they see it, theyll be reminded of you.A gift doesnt have to be too expensive, either. Its the thought that counts. A heartfelt gift will go a long way in strengthening the emotional connection in your relationship.\n",

            "3 Simple Ways to Tell if Your Lipstick Has Gone Bad - wikiHow\n",
            "Check if the color has changed or has white spots.\n",
            "As lipstick ages, it typically starts to fade or darken. You may even notice a color difference between the tip and base of the lipstick. Similarly, there may be white specs in the color that werent previously there. Look for these signs that the lipstick might be expired.[1]You may be able to cut the tip off a lipstick if its the only part thats discolored. However, its best to just replace the entire tube.\n",
            "Look for moisture beads along the surface of the lipstick.\n",
            "As lipstick ages, the ingredients may start to separate. As a result, you may see beads of oil forming along the lipstick. Check the length of your lipstick to see if there are any moisture beads, and throw away the tube if you see any present.[2]You may also see moisture collecting inside the tube. This is also a sign its time to toss your lipstick.\n",
            "Smell the lipstick to check for unpleasant odors.\n",
            "As lipstick goes bad, the odor changes, often becoming unpleasant. It may smell like potato starch or wax, but it might also smell rancid from the oils in the product. Do a sniff test to make sure your lipstick still smells like it did when you opened it.Once a lipstick starts to stink, just throw it away. Otherwise, youll be smelling it on your lips all day and could ingest a spoiled product.\n",
            "Apply the lipstick on your wrist to see if it spreads smoothly.\n",
            "When lipstick is still good, itll spread easily and in an even layer. Swipe the lipstick on your hand or wrist to check its quality. If it slides across your skin, its probably still good. However, its time to throw it out if its hard to apply or provides patchy coverage.Your skin may have germs on it. Wash your skin before you test the lipstick. You might also remove the tip of your lipstick afterwards or sanitize it with a spritz of alcohol.\n",
            "Feel the texture of the lipstick to see if it feels different.\n",
            "As the ingredients in lipstick break down, its normal for the texture to change. The product may become soggy, clumpy, dry, or gritty. Check for these types of changes before you apply the product to your lips. If the texture seems different, its time to replace your lipstick.[3]You can check the texture on your hand or wrist, but you may also need to press your clean finger lightly against the lipstick. In some cases, you can notice changes in texture by just looking at the lipstick. For instance, if you see gritty particles along the side of your lipstick, its probably bad.\n",
            "Notice if the lipstick feels dry or looks flaky after you apply it.\n",
            "If you think your lipstick is good but its dry or flaky while youre wearing it, its probably gone bad. Stop wearing your lipstick and throw it away if it leaves your lips dry or gritty, even if it otherwise looks and smells fine.Some matte lipsticks can leave your lips feeling dry even when theyre still good. However, you should have smooth, even lip color. If your lip color is flaky or patchy, replace your lipstick.\n",
            "Dont use lipstick you think may be expired.\n",
            "Lipsticks can be expensive, so you likely want to use your product for as long as possible. Unfortunately, old lipstick might harbor germs and bacteria that can be harmful to your health. Replace your lipsticks as soon as you think theyve gone bad to protect yourself.If youre worried about cost, limit how many tubes that you purchase at one time. For instance, you might stick to a day color, a night color, and a nude option.\n",
            "Throw out your lipstick if youve had it for 2 years or more.\n",
            "In general, lipsticks only last for 2 years at the longest once youve opened them. Even if your lipstick seems good after this point, its best to replace it. Let go of your old lipsticks and celebrate with a new tube.[4]Since trends change, it may be time to update your color palette anyway.An unopened lipstick can last up to 5 years.\n",
            "Expect long-wearing lipsticks to dry out faster.\n",
            "While long-wearing lipsticks can feel like a blessing, they may not last you as long as other formulas. Since long-wearing lipsticks contain ingredients that evaporate quickly, they typically dry out and go bad sooner. Check your long-wearing lipsticks after about a year of use to make sure they still look and smell good.[5]If you notice that your product is leaving your lips dry, it may be time to get a new tube of lipstick.\n",
            "Let go of lipstick thats been exposed to extreme heat.\n",
            "A lipstick thats been in the heat will likely lose its original texture and luster, and it could be harmful to your health. Not only is heat damaging to lipstick, it may also allow bacteria to grow on the product. Dont use a product that you know has been sitting in the heat.[6]For instance, throw out a tube that you left in your car or under a hot sun.\n",
            "How to Write an eBook: Drafting, Publishing & More\n",
            "Come up with an idea.\n",
            "eBooks are no different from any other type of book except in their medium of publication, so the most important first step to writing one is to decide on, and develop, an idea for one. The basic way to do this is to sit down and write a brief phrase or sentence that encapsulates the information you'd like to put in your book. Once you have that, you can build on it to create a finished product.Writers who plan to create a book of fiction will have to spend considerably more time coming up with ideas and plot points. Read this article on how to write a novel for more relevant advice.The eBook format has the advantage of being not only open to self-publishers, but essentially free for them, which means that books too short to really be worth printing on paper can make perfectly valid eBooks. Therefore, feel free to use a simple idea.\n",
            "Expand your idea.\n",
            "Start with the basic idea you wrote down, and think about different aspects of it. It may be helpful for you to draw a web of concepts to do this. For example, let's say you wanted to write a book about how to sell real estate for beginners. You could write down things like licenses and fees, selling techniques, and cost vs. expected returns. Connect specifics that are related to each of them, and so on, until you have enough detail to see the structure of the words in your head.[1]Different books call for different approaches. Memoirs and self-help books might do better with a vertical outline; a book of fixes for common household problems will probably come together faster using a web of ideas.\n",
            "Organize your details.\n",
            "After unpacking and expanding your core idea, you should have a lot of information about your basic topic written down. Rearrange and organize it in a vertical outline until it makes sense to you and matches the way you'd like your book to flow. Think in terms of what your audience will need to know first, and put basics at the beginning. Once those have been covered, more advanced concepts can follow without losing the reader.[2]Each step along your line will end up being a chapter in your book. If you can break the chapters into groups as well (for instance, if your book on home repairs has chapters that can be divided by room or type of problem), feel free to turn those into larger sections that contain a few related chapters each.\n",
            "Work on your first draft.\n",
            "Don't worry about a title, table of contents, or any of the other stylistic elements of the book yet. Just sit down and start writing it. You may find it's easier to start in the middle by writing a chapter of your choice first; you may prefer to start at the very beginning and write straight through. Just remember that you don't have to pick one method and stick with it. Use whatever techniques you need to complete the book.Writing a book  even a short book  takes time. The important thing is to persevere. Set aside time each day to write, or write until you hit a certain word count. Don't stand up from your desk until you meet your goal. Even if you feel stuck, the act of writing something down will help loosen up your mind, and before you know it your words will be flowing again. Keep at it for as long as it takes.\n",
            "Review and revise your draft.\n",
            "Once your book is finished, let it sit for a week or so, and then come back to it with a critical eye. Look at the order of the chapters and sections first. Do they make sense to you? Often, you'll find that some pieces seem to make more sense in a different spot than where you'd originally placed them. After you're satisfied with the order of the book, read each chapter in order and edit and revise it.[3]Like writing, editing takes time  not as much time, but still a significant amount. Pace yourself by editing a certain number of words or chapters each day.You will often find that words, like chapters, simply need to be rearranged. Do your best to keep related ideas together, and don't forget to alter connecting sentences so that the new order still fits the text.It has often been said that deletion is the soul of editing. If you find that a chapter is going down the proverbial rabbit-hole on a particular point, bring it back in line with the overall flow of that chapter by deleting the extra detail.If such information is absolutely vital, consider setting it aside in a sidebar instead, or try to incorporate it into the text so that it continues to flow smoothly when you read it.\n",
            "Add the title and other front/end materials.\n",
            "Once the body of your book looks solid, it's time to add a title, and any front or end material (such as an introduction or a bibliography) you'd like to add. Titles usually reveal themselves during the writing of the book; when in doubt, a plainspoken title (such as How to Sell Real Estate) is usually a safe choice.If you pick a very simple title, have a couple of alternates on hand in case it's already been used. Adding adjectives or even your own name (as in wikiHow's Guide to Selling Real Estate) are simple ways to do this.If you used information from elsewhere, always be sure to properly cite it in a bibliography. If your sources were friends, at least add in a page of acknowledgments so you can thank them by name.\n",
            "Add a cover.\n",
            "Like physical books, a major marketing tool for any eBook is its cover. Even though it's only a virtual cover, it's what potential buyers notice first. Consider springing for a professionally-designed cover, or go it alone if you think you can make something that looks good and will attract sales. Just be sure to get permission before you use any copyrighted images.Even sections and pieces of copyrighted images are off-limits. When in doubt, get explicit permission from the copyright holder first.\n",
            "Give ebooks to friends.\n",
            "Once you've written an awesome ebook, you should share some copies with friends, relatives, and neighbors.[4] In order to get feedback from others, make sure to ask:How was the book?What did you like the most?What did you not like?How can I improve it?\n",
            "Record the feedback and improve the ebook before you publish.\n",
            "Factor in all of the responses and try to address each of the issues that surfaced. Don't be afraid to stir everything into the mix and redo the entire ebook from top to bottom. The likely result will be a marked improvement on what you created alone. If not, you can always retool and back up to the previous draft.\n",
            "Gather pertinent information about your eBook before publishing.\n",
            "The more clear information you compile about your eBook, the easier a time you'll have in both getting it published and promoting it successfully. On a separate document, write down the title of your book, along with any section and chapter titles, the number of sections or chapters, the word count of the book, and a page number estimate. Once you have all that, come up with a list of descriptive terms or keywords that are related to your book, and a general thesis statement if needed.Contrary to what you may have learned in high school, not every piece of writing needs a thesis statement to work. However, most nonfiction writing will have an obvious thesis statement by the time you finish writing it.\n",
            "Determine the target audience of your eBook.\n",
            "Try to gauge the types of people who will be interested in your book based on its title and description. Are they young or old? Do they own homes or rent? How much money do they make annually, and do they prefer to save or spend? You don't need to hire an expert; just make your best guesses. This information is only to help you market your eBook later.\n",
            "Choose a publishing platform.\n",
            "There are a few different ways to publish your eBook, which vary in terms of piracy protection, royalties paid to you, and audience scope. Consider each one of them and choose the one you think will make you the most money.[5]\n",
            "Publish to e-Readers with KDP.\n",
            "One of the most commonly used is Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) platform. KDP allows you to format and publish your eBook to the Kindle Marketplace for free. Anyone who owns the popular Kindle line of e-readers can then purchase your book from the marketplace and read a copy on their Kindle. Under this setup, you keep 70% of the price of every copy you sell of your book, provided you set that price between $2.99 and $9.99. The main downside is that KDP doesn't publish to people without Kindle readers, limiting your audience.\n",
            "Research other eBook publishers.\n",
            "Services like Lulu, Booktango, and Smashwords are also available to take your manuscript and publish it for you in eBook format. Generally speaking, the basic service of these sites is free (and you shouldn't ever pay to publish your eBook, since it basically costs nothing), but they offer premium packages and services, like marketing and editing, for a fee. Be careful to avoid spending money when you didn't mean to if you go this route. On the plus side, these services can reach a much wider potential audience than KDP, and sometimes offer more royalties. Lulu, for example, pays a whopping 90%!\n",
            "Watch for hidden costs when working with a publishing platform.\n",
            "For any professional eBook publishing platform (including KDP), certain formats have to be used. There are services that will take care of the messy business of formatting your book for you, but they always charge a fee. It's much cheaper to do it all yourself, but you'll need to learn the rules of the service you plan to publish with, and then download and learn any necessary software programs to make the appropriate file conversions. If you do opt for a paid service, don't ever pay more than a few hundred dollars at most.Never work with a publisher that won't let you set your own price. Forcing a price can have detrimental effects on your bottom line in a few different ways, which essentially makes it another fee. As a general rule of thumb, eBooks turn the most profit when priced between $0.99 and $5.99 per copy.\n",
            "Self-publish with special software.\n",
            "If you'd prefer to publish your eBook on the Internet at large, and not use any specific site, there are a number of specially-designed computer programs that allow you to do just that. They vary widely in cost and features, but all of them allow you to create a finished eBook with no restrictions on where or how you sell it. Be aware that the anti-piracy measures you'll have access to with these programs are generally less effective than those offered by publishing services.Calibre is a newer program that is quick, powerful, and easy to use. It converts HTML files (and only HTML files) into EPUB (the industry standard) format easily, and costs nothing, though donations are appreciated by the creators. Most word processors can save your manuscript as HTML.Adobe Acrobat Pro is the gold standard program for creating PDF files, which can be read on nearly any computer or device. Acrobat allows you to password-protect your PDF file when you save it, though once you've given out the password, anyone who has it will be able to open the book. It's a powerful and flexible program, but it isn't free.OpenOffice.org is a popular free office suite that is similar to Microsoft Works. OpenOffice.org's Writer program (word processor) can save documents in PDF format just like Adobe Acrobat. Writer's tools aren't as advanced, particularly with regards to adding a cover, but the program can secure and encrypt your PDF just like Acrobat.There are many other programs available to help you self publish, both free and paid. If none of the above options sound perfect for you, explore online and find one that suits your needs.\n",
            "Promote your eBook.\n",
            "Once you've published your eBook and deposited it for paid download somewhere on the Internet, it's time to let the world know about it. There are many services you can pay for that will increase your visibility; these may be quite worth the investment if you suspect you have a book that could really take off. However, even with professional help, it will pay for you to promote the book yourself.[6]Use social media for visibility. Post about the book (and link to a place it can be bought!) on every social media site where you have a presence: Twitter, Facebook, and so on. Even LinkedIn is a good place to add a link to your book on your profile page.Think laterally to maximize exposure. Don't just tell people about your book; be clever and thorough. Link to it on StumbleUpon, take a photo of your computer screen and post it to Instagram, or even [Do-a-Youtube-Video| record a short video] and talk about the book on YouTube. Use every user-created platform at your disposal.Rely on yourself. People love it when authors are accessible. Advertise times for virtual Q and A sessions about the book, or send complimentary copies to bloggers who review eBooks and ask to do an interview.\n",
            "How to Understand Your Rabbit (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Listen to the sounds your rabbit makes.\n",
            "Realize that your rabbit will probably be silent most of the time. As a prey species, rabbits have learned to be quiet in order to escape the notice of predators.[1] Some rabbits do make an occasional noise, either when very happy, scared, or as a warning.This makes them very different from purring cats and barking dogs which use a whole vocal range to communicate.\n",
            "Keep an ear out for pleasure sounds.\n",
            "Rabbits have a limited repertoire of noises they make when they're happy. These include a very quiet purr, a soft clicking noise, and a very quiet grinding of the teeth noise, which means she is content.[2]These can be very quiet, so you'll need to pay close attention in order to hear the sounds. Your rabbit may softly grind her teeth or click while you're petting her in her favorite spot, like behind the ears or under the chin.Be aware teeth grinding can be a sign of distress, but in this case the noise is louder.\n",
            "Listen for warning noises.\n",
            "The classic warning signal is a thump with a back leg to warn other members of the group of danger. A rabbit that feels threatened and is angry enough to attack may make a series of grunting or growling sounds. Likewise loud teeth-grinding is another warning sound of annoyance. Some rabbits, faced with a threat, will hiss.[3]If you have two rabbits (one male and one female) and the male starts grunting, move him immediately, unless you are attempting to breed them. A grunting male is a sure sign that he is attempting to mate or breed with the female.\n",
            "Respond quickly to sounds of fright.\n",
            "Rabbits have a particularly penetrating and distressing scream. They reserve this for when they are extremely frightened or actually being attacked. If your rabbit screams, she may be in danger or pain.[4]If you notice your rabbit in pain, check for signs of obvious external injury and contact your rabbit's veterinarian immediately. Your rabbit may have a life threatening injury or internal issue that needs to be addressed right away.However, a rabbit's instinct as a prey species means when they are hurt they are most likely to hide or stay very still to avoid attracting attention, so do not rely on noise alone to alert you to discomfort.\n",
            "Notice signs of relaxation.\n",
            "Much of a rabbit's body language is subtle and understated, but you may see him relax. A relaxed rabbit may lie on his belly with his back legs stretched out behind him. He may also squat with all legs tucked beneath him and his ears softly held against his head.[5]A rabbit's ears are an early warning radar for danger, so ears in a neutral position indicate relaxation.\n",
            "Recognize submissive gestures.\n",
            "Your rabbit might try to make himself as small as possible, pulling his head and neck into his body and generally trying to disappear. He'll also avoid making direct eye contact with the rabbit (or person) he is submitting to.[6]A submissive rabbit is usually signalling to other rabbits in the warren that he is no threat.\n",
            "Calm a frightened rabbit.\n",
            "If frightened, your rabbit will press his ears hard against his head (trying to reduce his silhouette so a predator doesn't spot him) and his facial muscles will appear taut and tense. This has the effect of making his eyes appear to pop out of his head.[7]This is similar to a submissive rabbit, trying to make himself as small as possible.\n",
            "Make adjustments as necessary if your rabbit shows signs of irritation or dislike.\n",
            "Your rabbit will rapidly shake his head from side to side. He will also thump a hind paw against the ground to make a drumming sound.[8] If really irritated, he may even lunge at another rabbit or you.\n",
            "Learn to see signs of happiness or contentment.\n",
            "These are fun actions to look for. Your rabbit may perform binkies, or happy hops and twists in the air. Your rabbit may also run around your feet, showing that he's thoroughly enjoying life. He may also move his jaw as if chewing. All of these actions show that your rabbit is enjoying freedom of movement and is happy.If your rabbit isn't neutered, running around your feet may also indicate that your rabbit thinks you are an acceptable mate.Your rabbit might also lick your hands and face while he is being petted. This may be a sign that you are very special to him. He may even rub his chin on you, thereby marking you as its territory by leaving its scent.\n",
            "Respond to requests for attention.\n",
            "Your rabbit will give you plenty of clues that he needs your attention. These include: lightly nudging you with his nose, tugging on your clothes, climbing up your leg, hopping onto your lap, or nipping at your ankles. If your bunny nips at your ankles for attention, you can train him to stop by walking out of the room whenever he or she does this. Reward more polite behavior by petting him, talking to him, or giving him treats.Your rabbit might also make a noise that sounds like a goose honking. This signals that he's annoyed or wants attention. If your bunny is not neutered, he may make this sound when being amorous towards you or a soft toy.If your rabbit hops a few steps away, remains with its back to you, isn't occupied with anything else, and occasionally turns its head to see if you are still watching it, it is offended at something you've done. You can apologize by feeding him a treat, or giving a couple of pets on the head. You can also repeat this act to your rabbit if it does something to offend you. It will most likely come by to apologize, either with a few kisses or quick bumps.\n",
            "Watch for bathroom signs.\n",
            "Your rabbit may eat his droppings. There is no need for you to be concerned if your bunny does this. It's natural and should not be discouraged. You may also see your rabbit pushing out his bottom and tail before urinating.Rabbits need to digest some foods twice and they take these droppings directly from their bottoms. This is to ensure that they get all the nutrients that they need from their food. Your rabbit might make a low pitched squeak when he does this.[9]\n",
            "Realize that rabbits are a prey species.\n",
            "You can think of a rabbit as a 'listener' rather than a 'talker' because their lives are tuned to being on alert for danger. They use a highly developed sense of smell (hence the constant nose twitching), hearing (those wonderful long ears), and prominent eyes to watch for threats.This means it is even more important that you understand your rabbit, so you know what she does and doesn't like.

            "Read your rabbit's subtle signals.\n",
            "Nature intended rabbits to live underground in tunnels during the day, emerging at dusk and dawn (when it's more difficult for predator's eyes to spot them) to graze on grass and plants. Because they spend the majority of their time in the dark, rabbits make limited use of visual signals, such as nuanced facial expressions or body language.[10]\n",
            "Avoid picking up your rabbit, unless she likes it.\n",
            "Being picked up by a human can be a terrifying experience to some pet rabbits who go into a catatonic state, where the rabbit lies absolutely still, eyes open and staring, and does a good impression of being dead.[11]Rabbits are ground dwelling animals. In the wild, the only time they leave the ground is when they're picked up by a predator.\n",
            "Respect if your rabbit doesn't want to be handled.\n",
            "If that's the case, she will either scrabble, wriggle, and fight so hard you get scratched, or she will go completely still. Far from indicating she appreciates being cuddled, a rabbit that keeps deathly still in your arms is actually pretending to be dead in order to make the predator (you!) give her up as a bad meal and put her back down.[12]If your rabbit reacts in this way to being picked up, sit on the ground and encourage her to sit on your lap. This way her paws are in contact with a horizontal surface and she can learn to associate you with safety, rather than an instinctively alien and scary experience.If it's essential to pick the rabbit up, place a towel over her eyes, and use the rest of the towel to scoop her up. The darkness will help calm her.\n",
            "Avoid handling a rabbit that's biting or scratching.\n",
            "An aggressive rabbit has learnt to bite and scratch in order to avoid being picked up. Be aware that your rabbit is doing this out of fear and unease around humans.[13]Gradually gain your rabbit's trust. Don't try forcing your rabbit to cuddle or sit in your lap.\n",
            "Provide plenty of hiding places for your rabbit.\n",
            "Hiding can decrease his stress levels, so he may feel comforted knowing that he has lots of places to hide. This will also make your rabbit feel more secure.[14]\n",
            "Start keeping your rabbit company.\n",
            "At first, do not attempt to handle him, but offer treats (you can even feed him dandelions!) so that he associates tasty foods with human company. Sit down beside the hutch every day, talking in a soothing voice and giving treats, so he learns humans are no threat.[15]You can offer several kinds of fruits to your rabbit, such as grapes, apples, blueberries, and raspberries. Be sure to only give a very small amount, like a single grape or a couple of raspberries.[16]\n",
            "Begin interacting gradually.\n",
            "As your rabbit starts to venture out of his hiding place for treats, try to touch him briefly while he eats a treat. As the days and weeks go by, increase the amount of time you touch him until he's comfortable. Then you can try to entice him onto your lap (seated on the ground of course). This is also a great way of gaining a timid, frightened rabbit's trust.[17]\n",

Allow your emotion, not your mind, to dictate the movement of the pen or pencil.

            "Before you even begin to sing or practice breathing, place your hands on your back and abdomen, near waist-level. This will help you feel your bodys movement as you inhale and exhale deeply. You will feel your body expand as you breathe in and contract as you breathe out.[1]\n",
            "Inhale by filling your lower lungs with air.\n",
            "As you inhale with a deep breath, visualize yourself filling the lower portion of your lungs with air.[2] This will feel different from your normal breathing because our relaxed, daily breathing is usually quite shallow. As you breathe in, your hands on your back and abdoment should move outward.[3]It may help to visualize yourself filling your stomach with air, as it if is a balloon.\n",
            "Exhale by allowing your stomach to contract.\n",
            "As you exhale, try to exhale all of the air in your lungs, so that the next time you inhale, you will be starting with all new air. Imagine that your stomach is a balloon and you are deflating it. Your abdomen will contract at this point, moving your hands inward.[4]\n",
            "Do not move your chest.\n",
            "[5] As you breathe, do not allow your chest to move. Your chest and shoulders normally move up and down in your daily breathing, but when you are singing, you will want to always breathe from the deepest part of your lungs. When you are breathing from the lower part of your lungs (your diaphragm), your chest should very little, if at all.[6]Focus on breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Breathing horizontally means that your diaphragm and abdoment should move outward instead of the usual up-and-down movement that accompanies shallower breathing.\n",
            "Place one hand on your abdomen and the other on your back.\n",
            "You will place your hands near waist level. This will allow you to feel how your body moves as you inhale and exhale.\n",
            "Inhale forcefully.\n",
            "As you inhale through your mouth, visualize the air moving into your diaphragm, the muscles below your lungs that help you to inhale and exhale. Your hands should move outward as you fill your lower lungs with air.[7]\n",
            "Exhale forcefully.\n",
            "Use your stomach muscles and diaphragm to force the air rapidly and with force. Exhale through your mouth. You will feel your hands moving inward as your diaphragm contracts.[8]\n",
            "Repeat thirty times.\n",
            "As you do this, visualize yourself breathing horizontally, rather than vertically. Your abdomen will expand and contract horizontally as you do so.

            "The key to effective breathing for singing is in the breath. The most important aspect of breathing is breathing with your diaphragm, the muscles underneath your lungs that help them to move air in and out. A great way to visualize breathing with your diaphragm is to picture a rubber ring around your waist. This ring will move in and out, getting bigger and smaller, with each inhale and exhale.[10]\n",

During the inhale, you will feel your hands raise up and outward as they rest gently on your belly. As you breathe in, fill your abdomen from the bottom to the top, noticing your stomach rising first, then your chest.[14]You should not only feel your body expanding at the front, where your hands are, but also at the sides and back.Even when breathing diaphragmatically, expanding the side and back ribs is crucial for maximum air volume. To get a feeling for this, either wrap a resistance band around your rib cage or practice inhaling after your air has been tightly squeezed out.\n",

You will simply notice your stomach area contract, starting with your stomach and ending with your chest.Learn how to keep your ribcage up and expanded to control the airflow, and try exercises such as the ssss hold out in order to learn how to control your air. If you learn to control your air, you will soon be able to exhale for a count of 20 or more.\n",

Make sure your hands are in the right position  don't grip the board at its sides, but instead place them flat on the board very close to your chest.Lift up your chest using your hands. Remember to not look down  instead look straight up and don't move your head. Looking down or behind you can make you scared or unbalanced.\n",

            "This is when you go from laying on your stomach with your hands on the ground by your chest and elbows bent to pushing up your chest with your hands then popping or jumping into standing position. Standing position on a surfboard is with bent knees, feet wide apart, and feet and body facing either the left or right (your good side or whatever feels comfortable) while looking forward.[1]You have to be good at doing quick take offs on the ground before moving to the water. When you've paddled into the wave and you feel it take you and the wave angles you down, that's when you have to quickly pop up to standing, using this technique.Don't lean forward because you may flip your board over (scary!). A low center of gravity helps that, so bend your knees.\n",

Then bring your other leg up (your right one) to fully stand up. Place them about shoulder length apart and in the center of the board, in a sort of lunging position and twist with your hips until you are standing.Put out your hands like they do in the movies  it actually works for the balance.Once you have caught the wave, go from paddling position to a kneeling position by bringing your knees forward in one swift movement. Do not lean back while kneeling or you will fall off your board.\n",

Then, if you are a righty, put your left foot in front of your body and use it to lift up your right foot. Then ride the wave left or right as it crashes behind you.For a while, you're going to be snapped off your surfboard by the water. Don't get discouraged; each time you go out into the water, you're perfecting just what it is you have to do. It's a normal part of the learning curve.\n",

This will enable you to stay stable and get the maximum ride out of the wave.Place your front foot on the chest line and in a direction that goes across the deck, your back foot is placed so your legs are slightly wider than shoulder width.Keep your knees bent at all times. This will lower your center of gravity and assist you in keeping your balance on the surfboard.Push your hips forward to transfer your weight onto the front leg. Your back leg should dip in slightly to make your stance more comfortable and give you more style.Keep your arms up, especially your front arm.

Keep your arms up in \"surfer's position\" to establish directionality as you ride the wave and apply pressure or extra needed weight onto your front foot in accordance with your arms in order to steer.Stand with your dominant foot on the middle of the board and your back foot about 23 feet (0.60.9m) away from the back of the board.\n",

            "You wouldn't bet on a baby to run a marathon, so don't insert yourself in the line up right away if you don't have to. Paddle out to sea and catch a broken wave in shallower, white water nearer to the shore.Take a moment to master sitting on your board, too. While you're doing this, make sure you're always facing the waves  never turn your back on something that could seriously injure you. Anytime you're waiting for a wave, keep facing the horizon.\n",

            "This is a technique that allows you to go under breaking waves instead of getting pummeled time and time again each time you go out for a surf. There is a different technique for using a short or long board:[2]For short boards, gain speed as you approach the wave. Around 2 feet (0.6m) before making contact with the water, grab the edges of the surfboard between the nose and middle of your board. Push you weight onto your hands until the nose goes under. Put your head down and your body will follow. Once your body is below the surface, take your front leg and bend it down, using that knee to push the tail under the wave. This momentum will put you in the water for only a second or two.For long boards, push up your chest and let the wave pass under your body and over the board.  The \"shoot and scoot\" method is where you sit on the back of your board and put the tail of it into the water, grabbing the edges of the board at the center so it raises above the wave.\n",
            "Start angling your board.\n",
            "You don't just want to ride a wave to shore, you want to ride it parallel to shore for as long as possible. You want the longest possible ride with the most possible speed. Here's how:Bend your knees to keep a low center of gravity. Lightly lean your weight in the direction you want to go, toward the face of the wave. This will push the rail of your board into the water and elicit a keel effect that cuts into the water, directing your board.On a long board, use the rear section of your board to turn. If you lean too far forward, the rail will dig and you'll be off in no time.\n",
            "Study the waves.\n",
            "It'll take some time, but eventually you be able to predict wave behavior. In addition to being out there and in it, just observe the waves and how they act. Eventually you'll be able to spot the wave that's just right, the one that's in the Goldilocks zone. You'll be able to tell which waves are mushy and which are hollow, determining your course of action.\n",

Practice squatting like this until you can easily hold the position for several minutes.[1]Your heels, butt, and shoulders should all form a straight line when you're in the squat.If it's hard to balance in this position, you can put one hand on the ground until you get used to squatting.You can also put your feet flat on the ground at first if you need to. However, you'll need to stay on the balls of your feet for the actual dancethat will help you bounce more easily from one foot to the other.\n",

            "If you've had a bad day, leave it at home and be polite while on shift, even to the meanest customers. You don't need to be a pushover, but you're more likely to leave your customer happy and satisfied if you're slower but in a great mood than if you're the fastest cashier ever but snappy and rude. If you can't sincerely be cheerful, at least try to fake it.\n",
            "Ask the customer if \"they are having a good day\".\n",
            "Actually listen to their response and acknowledge their response. When they are walking out of the store, they will feel properly acknowledged and will likely come back to your store.\n",

If your cash register has quick buttons for some cash amounts, like $5, $10, or $20, get in the habit of using them. For the first few days, review your basics constantly while it's not busy, and ask a more experienced cashier to double check you to make sure you're doing everything exactly right.\n",

            "When there is not a long line, get into the habit of counting back the change to the customer instead of just handing them a bunch of bills. This cuts down on mistakes. Good practice in small retail businesses includes calling out large notes so that your coworker hears it. If there is a dispute and a customer claims to have given you more money than they did, you can use this standard practice to show that this is unlikely.\n",

It's also a good idea to know what to do if you make a mistake or a small problem comes up -  what's the routine if you give the wrong change but have already closed your cash, if someone wants a refund, or if your debit machine goes on the fritz?

It's a good idea to at least skim the full guidebook, so you'll know roughly what's in it and where to go if, say, the power goes out and you have to use that dusty manual debit card press in the back.\n",
            "Know the store's products well enough to make suggestions and compliments.\n",
            "Even if you're only a cashier and never expected to work the floor, you're still an employee and might be asked questions. If you happen to know something is a particularly good purchase, let the buyer know that they just got the first of a brand new product, or that you think that one's the nicest in the store and they made a great choice. Be sincere about this and don't overdo it, but a little compliment can create the perception of added value and make a customer even happier with their purchase.\n",

With an overhand grip, pull the bar straight up and back, leading with the shoulder, pulling the bar back.Another option is to do rows using dumbbells.[4] Stand next to a bench and place one knee on the bench. Then, place the hand on the same side of your body on the bench and grasp the dumbbell with your other hand.

            "How to Do a Critical Discourse Analysis: 11 Steps (with Pictures)\n",
            "Select a specific text that you'd like to analyze.\n",
            "In critical discourse analysis (CDA), the term text has many meanings because it applies to any type of communication, whether it's words or visuals. This includes written texts (whether literary, scientific, or journalistic), speech, and images. A text can also include more than 1 of these. For example, a text could have both written language and images. According to the University of Utrecht a discourse analysis can also be conducted on items without text if you \"read\" how the item conveys a message. If you're working on CDA in a college-level course, your professor may have already assigned you a text to work with. Otherwise, choose your own.[2]Texts could include things like Moby Dick, Citizen Kane, a cologne advertisement, a conversation between a doctor and their patient, or a piece of journalism describing an election.\n",
            "Look for words and phrases that reveal the text's attitude to its subject.\n",
            "Start your CDA at the most specific level: look at the words of your chosen text. Whether it's intentional or not, word choices can show the way an author feels about the subject of the text. Ask yourself: What specific tone or attitude are these words conveying?[3]As a first step, circle all of the adverbs and adjectives in the text. Then, consider what they might suggest about the tone of the piece.Look for tone words to help you figure out what the author is trying to convey.For example, say you're looking at a piece of political journalism about the president. If the text describes the president as the goofball in the Oval Office, the attitude is sarcastic and critical.However, if the president is described as the leader of the free world, the attitude is respectful and even reverential.If the article simply refers to the president as the president, its attitude is deliberately neutral, as if the text refuses to take sides.\n",
            "Consider how the text includes or exclude readers from a community.\n",
            "One of CDA's main claims is that all language is social and communicative. Texts build social communities by using specific words and phrases to help readers feel engaged and understood. Look at your text and spot a few places where it works to build a community. Identify the audience the author is addressing, and explain why you came to that conclusion.[4]For example, think about a news report about international immigrants coming to a country. The newscaster can create different types of community by referring to the immigrants as strangers, refugees, or aliens.The word refugees will prompt sympathy among listeners and will help build a community between citizens and immigrants, while alien will help create hostile feelings and will exclude the immigrants from the nation's community.\n",
            "Look for assumed interpretations that the text has already made.\n",
            "As a critical reader, it's your job to analyze the assumptions that exist in texts that less-critical readers may overlook. Read closely to find spots where language, tone, and phrase choices reveal textual biases about its subject matter. Every text has implicit assumptions, and it's your job as a CDA analyst to identify them.[5]For example, an 18th century short story that begins, The savages attacked the unarmed settlers at dawn, contains implicit interpretations and biases about indigenous populations.Another story that begins, The natives and settlers made a peaceful arrangement, has a comparatively benign interpretation of historical events.\n",
            "Think about the way your text has been produced.\n",
            "Textual production means how a text was created, which includes the historical context, cultural context, authorship, and format. This can carry a lot of meaning. In the case of literature, if a text was composed by 1 author, many of their personal views may be expressed in the text and give it a bias. If the text is a document of selected famous quotations, though, it will not show a single individual's beliefs or biases since it's been written by multiple authors.[6]For example, think about the difference between an author who writes a novel for money and one who writes for their own pleasure.The first author would want to tap into popular trends ends of the day in order to profit, while the second author would be less concerned with pleasing the public.\n",
            "Examine the form of the text and consider who has access to it.\n",
            "Within CDA, a text's form and its audience are closely related. The form of a text can be more or less accessible in ways that show who the text's creator wants to have access to the text and who they would like to remain outside of the community that the text creates.[7]For example, consider the case of a CEO delivering a speech in person to their company. The fact that they're delivering a speech and not sending an open letter shows that openness and transparency are important to the CEO and the company culture.If the CEO did not deliver a speech, but only sent an email to board members and top executives, the formal change would imply that the text had a very different audience. The email would make the CEO seem less personal, unconcerned about their own workers, and elitist in who they chose to address.\n",
            "Analyze quotations and borrowed language in your text.\n",
            "Think about what these quotes are doing and what the author might be trying to communicate. Texts commonly include quotes, borrow passages from other well-known texts, or pay homage to famous texts. Quotations can place a text into a certain literary or journalistic tradition, can show a reverence for history and the past, or can reveal the type of community that the text's creator would like to build.[8]For example, say that a contemporary writer opens a poem or story with: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Quoting Charles Dickens at once shows that the author is well-read and also grounds their writing in the English Victorian literary tradition.\n",
            "Examine ways in which texts reveal traditions within a culture.\n",
            "Texts are powerful tools that can both reveal and create cultural values and traditions. As a CDA analyst, look for cultural clues within the texts that you're analyzing. A text can reveal ways in which the text's creator (or a group of people that the author is representing) feels about cultural traditions, or can shape the way a culture develops.[9]For example, if a political speakers says, our forefathers smile upon us today, they are using patriarchal language.The term culture should be taken very broadly. Businesses can have cultures, as can communities of all sizes, countries, language groups, racial groups, and even hobbyists can have specific cultures.\n",
            "Contrast similar texts to find differences between the social cultures.\n",
            "When you're doing a CDA analysis, it's productive to compare similar textse.g., 2 advertisements or 2 screenplayswith one another. This can lead to new understandings of the texts themselves. Comparing 2 texts can also help analysts understand differences between the social values held by different communities and cultures.[10]For example, consider 2 different magazine ads for trucks. In the first, a rugged-looking man sits in a truck below the words The vehicle for men. In the second, a family sits in a truck and the ad copy reads, A truck to hold everybody.The first ad seems to rely on stereotypical ideas of masculinity, while the second seems more inclusive.\n",
            "Determine whether norms are held by a culture or a sub-culture.\n",
            "Many large groupsincluding businesses and other organizationscontain many smaller sub-cultures. These sub-cultures typically have their own norms and traditions that may not be shared in the large culture as a whole. You can analyze whether a view is held in a large culture or a small sub-culture by figuring out the intended audience for the group's texts and understanding how the text is received by different groups.[11]For example, imagine a politician whose slogan is All energy should come from coal! Because of the extremity of the stance, you may suspect that the candidate represents a fringe party that doesn't share many of the mainstream party's views.You could confirm this suspicion by looking at other candidates' speeches to see how they address the fringe candidate. If other candidates critique the fringe candidate, the latter is likely part of a sub-group whose views aren't shared by the main political culture.\n",
            "Consider ways in which cultural norms may exist internationally.\n",
            "In a small number of cases, power grounded in texts and textual practices create such a strong culture that it crosses national boundaries. As a CDA analyst, it's your job to figure out where this type of culture exists. The effects of a strong international culture can be positive or negative. In the corporate world, for example, a shared culture could encourage tolerance and inclusivity or it could encourage exploitation and abuses of power.[12]For example, companies like Ikea, Emirate Airlines, and McDonald's have strong cultures and norms that exist internationally.\n",

I feel warmth from the sunlight flooding my space, but the fans keep me cool.At my dream job, I work on an amazing team and enjoy spending time with my coworkers. I have lots of space and have decorated my office with my favorite mementos.

Since obstacles always pop-up, create if-then plans so you have a fallback to help you stay on track.[2]If your dream is to be a singer, your action plan might say, 1) Do open mic nights; 2) Record myself singing at home and post it online; 3) Do some small gigs in coffee shops and restaurants; 4) Record an EP; 5) Post my music on Spotify and iTunes.Your if-then plan might include things like, If I cant find open mic nights near me, Ill branch out to other cities, or If my recordings dont sound good, Ill watch a tutorial to learn how to improve them.\n",

It hurts to get criticism like that, but everyone whos written a good book went through the same thing.

            "Project a neat and clean look with your clothes and styling.\n",
            "You may have more flexibility in your attire than previous generations of teachersa male teacher may not be expected to wear a jacket and tie, for instance. No matter the dress code (or lack thereof) at your school, though, focus on maintaining a professional look. Come to work looking the part of a teacher, not trying to dress like your students.[1]Your clothing doesnt have to be stuffy and buttoned-up, but aim for modest, clean, wrinkle- and damage-free clothes.You might pair a skirt or slacks with a blouse or sweater, for instance, or wear slacks and a collared shirt with either a sweater or a jacket and perhaps a tie.When it comes to personal grooming, try not to look like you just rolled out of bed or like youre heading out to a club.\n",
            "Behave professionally in public.\n",
            "Students and the community at large will see you as a teacher even when youre not working, so make sure you represent your school and profession well in your daily life. Be someone who others can respect no matter the situation.[2]To name an extreme example, getting into drunken brawls on your free time will cause community members to lose respect not only for you, but perhaps also for the profession at large.Dont bad-mouth the school or gossip about school employees or students.\n",
            "Maintain professionalism on social media.\n",
            "Social media can be a great way for you to connect with students, parents, and colleagues, but it can also be a gateway to unprofessional or even inappropriate behavior. You should keep your personal and professional social media profiles separate, and keep stringent privacy settings for each.As a general rule of thumb, dont say anything on social media that you wouldnt say in the classroom.Resist the temptation to get overly chatty or to overshare on social media. Retain a degree of professional distance in your dealings with students and others in your capacity as a teacher.Don't post photos of your students on social media without their consent and their parent or guardian's consent.Check if your school has social media guidelines or policies in place.\n",
            "Prepare thoroughly for each day of teaching.\n",
            "Check your planner the evening before and get ready for the following day. Professional teachers plan thoroughly for every lesson and class. Then, they stick to their work program and assessment schedule.[3]This ensures that syllabus content is covered, and also the necessary skills for their students' longer-term success in their specific subject or learning area.A professional teachers workday doesnt end with the school bell at the end of the day, and it always starts before the morning bell the next day.\n",
            "Come to work on time every day.\n",
            "A professional teacher understands the need to start the day well, every day. The first impression you make each morning sets the tone for the rest of the day.[4]Arrive early enough that you have time to get all your papers and lesson plans in order, and so you can get yourself mentally prepared to start the day right.\n",
            "Follow the procedures and the protocols expected at your school.\n",
            "True professionals, in any field, embrace the corporate identity and values, and model these for the clients. In the case of a teacher, that means being a team player with your fellow teachers and the school administration, and projecting this shared focus to your students.[5]Even if you have doubts or differences of opinion with the corporate identity or procedures at your school, dont let this bleed into your teaching.\n",
            "Dont miss deadlines or fall behind on your grading.\n",
            "Professionals keep their work up to date and plan ahead. If youre always pushing deadlines back or making promises you cant keep, youll lose respect in the eyes of your students and peers.[6]When it comes to grading, a 3-day rule of thumb is a good starting point for shorter assignments and non-essay tests. For longer assignments, stick to a 2-week turnaround. If you take too long to hand back tests and so on, the students may lose interest in the task and their results by the time you return their work.\n",
            "Embrace change and give new methods a chance.\n",
            "Dont be a doomsayer and throw cold water on new ideas or suggestions for positive change. Instead of vocalizing negative thoughts like \"That will never work at this school,\" respectfully note any concerns you may have but show your willingness to try out something different.[7]Dont immediately discount suggestions or new ideas from students as well. Let them know that their opinions and perspectives are valued.\n",
            "Seek new subject knowledge to share with your students.\n",
            "Take continuing education courses to keep yourself mentally stimulated. Your renewed enthusiasm for your subject will be rewarded by increased student interest and enthusiasm for the subject itself.[8]A true professional--as a teacher or in any other career--never stops learning.Also make sure you keep abreast of education policy and legislation.\n",
            "Be passionate, positive, and enthusiastic about your work.\n",
            "Never act like its a chore to be in the classroom, even if it feels that way from time to time. Instead, project positivity and enthusiasm for your students.[9]If you need a positivity boost yourself, take some time each morning or between classes to remind yourself why you got into teaching and what you get out of it.Retain this positive enthusiasm beyond the classroom as well. For instance, a professional teacher will not create negativity in a staff room or engage in mindless gossip.\n",
            "Attend professional development courses to gain new skills.\n",

            "Stand at the start line with the egg and spoons ready.\n",
            "To create the start line, you can put down a piece of rope or tape, or even just line everyone up evenly along the grass or floor. Have everyone place the egg carefully on their spoon so theyre ready to go![2]Its common for people to hold one arm behind their back as they do the egg race while the other arm balances the egg, though this isnt required.Make sure everyone knows where theyre trying to go, and that the finish line is clear and visible.\n",
            "Begin the race with a specific word or sound.\n",

            "If youre doing the egg race with young kids, plastic eggs are a good option as they wont make a mess, and you can even fill them with things. Hard-boiled eggs are good for older kids and adults, and if youre feeling adventurous, you could even use raw eggs.[8]If you dont have eggs or you run out of them, you can also use ping pong balls or other small balls that will fit in a tablespoon.\n",
            "Carry the spoon in your mouth for a fun alternative to using your hands.\n",
            "Instead of having all the players carry the egg and spoon in their hand, have each player put the handle of the spoon in their mouth, balancing the egg as they walk. This will take extra balancing skills and more focus![9]Use plastic spoons for easy cleanup, or regular metal kitchen spoons to make balancing the egg easier.\n",
            "Switch up your movements to make the walking more fun.\n",
            "Ask everyone to waddle like a duck, hop like a rabbit, or even crawl like a crab. These new movements will make the race more difficult while also making it even more entertaining.[10]Have each player walk backwards for an even trickier egg race.If your movements require moving on the ground or walking without being able to see where youre going, its important to make sure the path is clear so there arent any injuries.\n",

            "Put your vehicle in park with the emergency brake up. Don't park on a steep slant like a hill. Although unlikely, rolling is always a concern with any sort of vehicular maintenance.Since you'll be using soap or commercial wheel cleaners for this method, you won't want to park somewhere where your rinse water will run into a storm drain. Instead, try parking on your lawn  the grass will absorb the water and chemicals without polluting your area's water supply.\n",
            "Remove the hubcaps from your vehicle's wheels.\n",
            "Most modern hubcaps can be removed by prying them off with your fingers or a wide-tipped removal tool.[2] However, some select types of hubcaps are secured by lug nuts or plastic screws. If you're unsure which type of hub caps you have, consult your owner's manual. Trying to pry off bolted-on lug nuts can break or crack them.The hubcaps can (and should) be washed, rinsed and dried separately from the aluminum wheels. Don't forget to wash the insides of the hubcaps  brake dust also settles here.\n",
            "Make sure the wheels are cool before beginning.\n",
            "The process of braking generates intense friction between the brake pad and the disc (or rotor). After heavy braking, this can cause the disc or other parts of the wheel to become quite hot. If you've just driven your vehicle, give your wheels a chance to cool off and prevent painful burns.To determine whether or not your wheels are hot, carefully move the back of one hand toward the wheel once the hub caps are off. Back off and give your vehicle a few minutes to cool down if you feel any radiating heat.Note that excessive heat after driving can be a sign of problems with your breaks.[3] Consider having your brake pads examined if you notice major heat radiating off of the wheel.\n",
            "Consider putting on a face mask and gloves when working around brake dust.\n",
            "It's important to note that there is some evidence that, over time, exposure to brake dust can contribute to a type of cancer called mesothelioma.[4] However, the link is not yet well-understood and it is thought that the cancer-causing effects may be limited to asbestos-containing brake pads.To be safe, you may want to consider wearing a basic surgeon's mask and protective gloves whenever you're working with brake dust. However, no matter which precautions you take (or do not take), a single exposure to brake dust is very unlikely to lead to cancer.\n",
            "Make a mixture of warm, soapy water.\n",
            "For a cheap, easy brake dust cleaner, try mixing soap and warm water. Squirt a teaspoon or so (about 20 milliliters) of dish detergent into a bucket and add warm water from the sink.Briefly stir the mixture a few times with your hand or a stick before beginning.\n",
            "Give the wheels a quick rinsing.\n",
            "Spray the aluminum wheels with water from a hose (not your soapy water) to loosen accumulated grit and grime. Removing this unwanted material now prevents it from scratching your wheels while you scrub.For extra power, screw a hose attachment onto a hose and use the \"jet\" setting.\n",

            "Next, grab a small hand brush. Dip it in your soapy water and start to scrub the wheel. The brake dust should come off fairly easily, but it may take some light pressure to remove built-up deposits. Be patient and take your time, being sure to scrub every inch of your wheels  don't forget the inside surfaces, which can be easy to see if you have open-spoked wheels.The best brushes for this job are small, maneuverable automotive brushes with soft or medium-stiff bristles. Some auto stores sell \"wheel brushes\" specifically made for this task which look somewhat like toilet-cleaning brushes. A toothbrush or an infant bottle washer work well for those hard to reach areas of the wheel.Don't use a stiff, harsh brush (like the steel-bristled kind you may use to clean your grill). These brushes can scratch and mar your wheels' aluminum finish.\n",
            "Consider using a washing mitt.\n",
            "One cleaning accessory you may want to consider to make your job easier is called a washing mitt. This looks like a rubber mitten with a brush attached to the fingers. Some vehicle maintenance experts claim these make it easier to clean in  wheels' hard-to-reach cracks, while others prefer traditional brushes.If you're looking to experiment, cleaning mitts are usually available for quite cheap at auto repair stores  usually not much more than $10 or so.[5]\n",
            "Rinse each wheel, removing all soap residue.\n",
            "When you've given your vehicle a good scrubbing, hit it with the hose to remove the dust and any soap suds.Repeat for each wheel as you clean them. It's usually faster to scrub all of your vehicle's wheels, then rinse them, rather than scrubbing and rinsing each individually, because you don't spend as much time switching between the scrubbing tools and the hose.\n",
            "Repeat the scrubbing process as needed.\n",
            "After you rinse, you may notice that you missed a few spots on your wheels. If this is the case, simply scrub and rinse again until you're satisfied with your result!\n",
            "Grab a can of a suitable wheel cleaner.\n",
            "Commercial wheel-cleaning fluids (usually sold for less than $10)[6] work well for removing accumulated brake dust. However, before you buy a can of wheel cleaner, be sure to read the label  some cleaners are formulated only for wheels made of certain types of metal and can actually damage the finish if used incorrectly.In a study, Consumer Reports found that Eagle One, Meguiars, and Mothers brand products were among the most effective at cleaning wheels. However, the same study noted that Zep Industrial Purple Cleaner & Degreaser (an all-purpose cleaner) worked even better.[7]\n",
            "Spray the cleaner directly onto the wheel.\n",
            "Spray your wheel cleaner onto the wheel (or apply as directed). Be sure to cover all areas of the wheel that you wish to clean.Note that certain types of wheel-cleaning fluid will advise you to wear eye, mouth, and hand protection and not to breathe in the product's fumes. If you are unsure whether you are adequately protected, consult your product's label.\n",
            "Consider using oven cleaner.\n",
            "If you don't want to spend the money on wheel cleaning fluid or you simply can't find a product that's right for your vehicle's wheels, you may want to consider using oven cleaner. According to some amateur sources, oven cleaner is comparable to commercial cleaners in terms of its ability to remove built-up grime and brake dust from wheels.[8]Note, however, that oven cleaner is not specifically designed to be used on metal wheels. Thus, it's possible that using oven cleaner may have negative effects on your wheels' finish, so use caution if you're especially concerned about your wheels' appearance.\n",
            "Allow the cleaner to \"soak in\".\n",
            "Once you've applied your wheel cleaner, give it a few minutes to loosen the brake dust. The recommended waiting time may vary from product to product  consult your product's label for more information.\n",
            "Scrub with a cleaning brush.\n",
            "After the cleaner has soaked into your wheel, start to scrub it off. While you can do this with anything from an old rag to a toilet-cleaning brush, automotive wheel brushes typically work the best.As noted above, you'll want a soft or medium-bristled brush for this job. Any stiffer and your brush may scratch or mar your wheels' finish.\n",
            "Rinse and re-apply as needed.\n",
            "Just as with the soap and water method above, you'll want to rinse your wheels with a hose after scrubbing them, taking care to remove any excess foam or suds. As noted above, don't let the rinse water drain into a storm drain, as wheel-cleaning chemicals can be harmful to local water supplies.Rinsing may reveal spots on the wheels that you missed. If so, don't be afraid to apply a second coating, scrub, and rinse again.\n",
            "Dry each wheel immediately.\n",
            "Once you're happy with the way your wheels look, don't wait to dry them off. If you do, small water droplets may dry on them, giving them an unappealing, spotty appearance. You've just worked hard to get your wheels looking great, so don't forget this crucial step!The best towels for this job are older, worn-out terry cloth towels or all-purpose cleaning wipes. You want a soft towel so that you don't leave swirl marks, but high-quality towels (like those made from microfiber) can be ruined by using them on wheels, even after they're clean.\n",
            "Consider applying a wax for long-term protection.\n",
            "A high-quality paste wax can help keep your wheels in tip-top shape by preventing brake dust from building up and causing pitting in the future. Before you replace your hubcaps, consider waxing your wheels  it doesn't take long and it's a good long-term investment.For maximum protection, re-wax your wheels every six months as part of their regular maintenance.\n",
            "Replace each hubcap.\n",
            "After you have finished washing, rinsing and drying the wheels, you're more or less done. Replace your vehicle's hub caps (which you may want to soak and clean separately) to finish this job.\n",

For example, they may dress in an overly seductive way, or wear outrageous clothes or costumes as a way to seek attention. These people may attend events or social situations in which they can easily be the center of attention. Often, the behavior may be interpreted as inappropriate, over-the-top, or overly seductive.[2]Behavior may be overly theatrical or purposefully flamboyant as a way to get peoples attention. For example, a woman guest may wear a wedding dress to another womans wedding, or a man may show up in an animal costume to a formal event.Someone with HPD may frequently dress inappropriately or in an attention-getting way, like by wearing revealing or seductive clothing to work, or putting on lots of jewelry or makeup.These people are often considered the life of the party.

            "A person with histrionic personality disorder may respond to minor problems as if they are major or life-threatening. Instead of finding solutions, this person may exaggerate the severity of the problem or create other problems where they do not exist. Even minor problems provide the opportunity to create drama, which allows the person to draw more attention to themselves.[3]For example, a person may date someone for one week and when the relationship does not work out, they may threaten suicide.Instead of taking responsibility, the person may blame other people or external factors for their own problems.For example, if the persons business fails due to negligence and poor decision making, they may blame staff, location, bad customers, or other external factors.The person's behavior or reactions may be so intense or attention-grabbing that it may frighten, embarrass, or otherwise put off the people around them.\n",
            "Note excessively dramatic speech.\n",
            "This person may speak very dramatically or emphatically. They may express strong opinions. Yet, when pressed, this person may be hesitant to respond or avoid giving details to provide any sort of evidence for the opinions.[4] The person may appear more concerned with expressing the opinion than supporting it. For example, the person may have very strong and controversial beliefs, such as saying that all countries should be communist or that having children should be regulated by the government. When asked why, they may not give a direct answer or provide any reasons for these beliefs.They may inject themselves into conversations with a strong, opinionated statement - such as suddenly interrupting a meeting at work to say that the current project will make the company will go bankrupt.\n",
            "Notice self-centered behavior.\n",
            "A person with HPD may seem to be overly focused on themselves, wanting to talk about themselves or their thoughts, without showing much concern for other people's perspectives or problems (and may even minimize them). As a result, someone with HPD may have strained relationships and others may view them as selfish, uncaring, or insensitive.[5]\n",
            "Be alert for impulsivity.\n",
            "A person with HPD might constantly seek out high-energy situations or events, and do things without forethought to get attention. They may also have strong or harsh reactions to things without considering how their actions might affect other people, which can strain their relationships.[6]\n",
            "Observe shallow emotions.\n",
            "A person with histrionic personality disorder may be overly dramatic, yet may be shallow or unable to relate to others in their own personal emotional experience. Emotions may change rapidly and others may perceive the individual as disingenuous or insincere.[7]For instance, the person may mention feeling extremely upset about something, but later become almost euphoric, as though the upsetting event never happened. They may seem to feel their emotions in very shallow extremes.It may seem to others like the person is constantly acting out their emotions or faking their feelings or responses, like they're putting on a performance.Does the person appear difficult to relate to? If you bring up a problem, does this person make it about themselves instead?\n",
            "Recognize a need for reassurance or approval.\n",
            "[8] This person may want assurance that they are accepted by others. The individual may check in on their social status, or do things to purposefully gain attention from others or create a reaction. As a result, this person may be easily susceptible or prone to peer pressure. They may also be easily influenced by other peoples opinions.This person may say, I know that Jordan hates me, but you think Im a good friend, right? To gain approval, this person may do things like buy gifts to gain acceptance, or put down other people to make themselves look better.This person may be overly sensitive to criticism or disapproval.[9] This may result in an emotional explosion or blaming others.\n",
            "Identify an overestimation of closeness in relationships.\n",
            "Someone with histrionic personality disorder may believe they have many close friendships when in reality, people are more acquaintances or shallow friends. This person may also overestimate the level of intimacy in romantic relationships. The behavior can get in the way of truly intimate relationships.This person may act overly familiar with strangers or acquaintances.Someone with HPD may make inappropriate advances on others, such as propositioning coworkers or people they hardly know, or broaching professional boundaries (e.g. trying to befriend their psychiatrist).[10]\n",
            "Notice discomfort in being ignored.\n",
            "Fear may exist around being ignored, so the person may create attention around themselves. This person receives social validation by gaining the attention of others. If this person is not in the center of attention, they may feel uncomfortable or unappreciated.[12] They may respond to feeling uncomfortable by doing something outrageous to feel comfortable again.When thinking about this person, do you notice that they crave attention and cannot be without it? How does this person respond when ignored or overshadowed?\n",
            "Note if the person is easily bored.\n",
            "Someone with HPD may become restless with routines or mundane activities and frequently seek out excitement. They may frequently change things up or drop activities or projects midway through, and struggle with delayed gratification.[13] It may seem like they thrive on excitement or drama, and can't be without it.Someone with HPD may constantly switch from job to job, friendship to friendship, and relationship to relationship as a means of excitement.\n",
            "Discern between histrionic personality disorder and anxiety disorders.\n",
            "People with anxiety disorders may catastrophize about problems, and act as if they are much more serious than they really are. They also may need lots of reassurance from others. However, there is usually no desire to be the center of attention. For instance, someone with illness anxiety disorder (hypochondria) may frequently go to the doctor over little things, but this is because they genuinely think they're sick, not to get attention.Anxiety can often co-occur with histrionic personality disorder.\n",
            "Distinguish histrionic personality disorder from narcissistic personality disorder (NPD).\n",
            "HPD and NPD can both involve attention-seeking behavior, self-centeredness, difficulty handling criticism, and trouble with empathy. However, NPD involves feelings of grandiosity and an inflated self-importance, and the person doesn't require attention to feel validated.[14] Signs of NPD include:[15]Heightened feelings of importance, entitlement, or talentFantasizing about power, importance, intellect, or attractivenessManipulating others for their own gainWanting others to think of them as important or be jealousNotable lack of empathy\n",
            "Differentiate between histrionic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder (BPD).\n",
            "HPD and BPD may involve intense relationships, behavior viewed as attention-seeking, and explosive reactions. Unlike in HPD, someone with BPD tends to have a negative self-image, feels their emotions very intensely, and may see situations or relationships in black-and-white.[17] Signs of BPD include:[18]Fear of abandonment, taking action to avoid being abandoned, and struggling to trust other peopleIdealization (thinking the best of someone) and devaluation (thinking the worst of someone) in interpersonal relationshipsIntense, hard-to-control emotionsConfusion or uncertainty over their sense of self (unstable identity)DissociationConstantly feeling empty or hollowSelf-injurious behavior and/or suicidal thoughts or intent\n",

            "Both histrionic and dependent personality disorder involve an intense need for approval, rapidly-progressing relationships, and \"clingy\" or seemingly attention-seeking behavior. However, someone with dependent personality disorder tends to avoid the theatrical or seductive behavior of HPD, and is often more inhibited due to fear of abandonment.[19] Signs of dependent personality disorder include:[20]Feeling unable to take care of themselves or be independentDifficulty in making any decisions independently; having others make decisions for themFrequently seeking support, reassurance, or comfort from othersStruggling to disagree or voice opinions that are different from others; being a people-pleaserFear of not being in a close relationship, or of being abandoned\n",
            "Obtain a psychological evaluation.\n",
            "A psychologist may diagnose histrionic personality disorder through use of evaluation and observation. Personal, medical, and family history will be discussed. The psychologist may assess the frequency, duration, and severity of the symptoms. Common factors to assess include behavior, appearance, and personal history.[21]It can be important to assess a persons social and romantic history to gain insight on how they relate with others.\n",
            "Identify onset.\n",
            "Histrionic personality disorder is most often diagnosed in the late teens or early 20s.[22]  Adolescents commonly display behavior that is immature or dramatic, yet this behavior typically decreases and is replaced with more mature or socially adaptive behavior and emotional regulation.[23] If the behavior increases or does not improve into adulthood, then histrionic personality disorder may be considered.Histrionic personality disorder is more often diagnosed in women than men, however, this may reflect socially acceptable roles and not the actual prevalence of histrionic disorder in the general population.[24] For example, a woman who is more sexually forward may be considered outside the norm, while this may be considered normal behavior for men.\n",
            "Note co-occurring disorders.\n",
            "Many people with histrionic personality disorder may experience depression and/or anxiety as a result of their conflicts with others or after a failed romantic relationship. They may also feel depressed when not the center of attention or when alone. Sometimes, treatment is sought to cope with the depression.[25]Substance use is common in those with histrionic personality disorder.If a person uses substances that  affect their functioning, substance treatment may be necessary.\n",
            "Be aware that there's no known cause of histrionic personality disorder.\n",
            "Although there are no direct links associated with histrionic personality disorder, there may be some probable causes or associated traits. For example, genetic influences and early childhood experiences may contribute to the experience of this personality disorder.[26]Childhood experiences might include learning behaviors or responses from adults. This could be unpredictable attention given as a child. A child may become confused when feedback is inconsistent or when they dont know how to interpret when parents are pleased.\n",

If you don't need to access your books regularly, plastic tubs are a good choice.Most retailers sell a variety of storage bins, in various sizes. Try to get relatively small boxes, no bigger than 12 x 12 in., or the bins will become quite heavy.It's fine to store these books anywhere the temperature will be consistent and cool. Attics and garages will be fine in certain climates. Polyurethane plastic tubs should protect books adequately from insects and rodents who might chew up books.\n",

Generally, unless books become very soiled, basic dusting and proper temperature and environment control should be enough to keep them clean long-term.Start dusting by removing all the books from your shelves and cleaning the shelves thoroughly, dusting them and wiping them down before reshelving the books.[5]\n",
            "Wipe books down with a clean magnetic or lint-free cloth.\n",
            "The best way to clean old books is with a microfiber cloth that traps dust inside. Instead of just blowing the dust around, as with a feather duster, these types of cloths will trap the dust and remove it completely. They've commonly sold at most home retail stores.Don't use water or other solvents to Try to clean books. If you have a very rare book that's gotten dirty, take it to a book dealer in your area and talk about restoration methods. Most books should not need to be cleaned in any way other than gentle dusting.[6]\n",
            "Start cleaning from the \"head\" to the \"tail\" of the book.\n",
            "If you're storing books upright on the shelf, most books will only be dusty or dirty at the top of the cover, and on the top binding of the book. The bottoms will usually be mostly clean. When you're cleaning then, start at the top, wiping down gently with the cling-cloth and wiping dust from the book.\n",
            "Use a small hand-vac in the hinges.\n",
            "If your books are very dusty, it may be good to use a small hand-vac, or the tube function on your regular vacuum cleaner to gently suck the dust out of the hinge in the binding. Run the vacuum over the top of the books while they're still stacked to get the most dust out of there, before you go back over them individually with a cloth. This can be a good way to get the worst out of the way first.\n",
            "Vacuum the room regularly.\n",
            "Most of the dust in a book room will be tracked in from the floor, actually. While dusting the shelves themselves is important, paying attention to cleaning the room regularly will help to keep your books in their prime condition. Vacuum and sweep the floors at least once a week, if your books are in a high-traffic area, to keep your books from needing more substantial cleaning.\n",
            "Pick an appropriate book shelf.\n",
            "The best, most organized, and most secure way to store books is on shelves designed for the purpose. Its clean, accessible, and allows you to easily peruse the books that you have quickly. They're available at most home retailers and are always a good choice.Natural, pre-treated wood and sheet metal are the best surfaces on which to store books. Storing books on shelves with synthetic paint or other chemicals can leech into the binding and paper, affecting the quality of the items.[7]\n",
            "Display books in stacked crates.\n",
            "One more quirky and off-kilter way to store and access your books is to line them up in a series of stacked wooden crates. Old milk crates or other boxes of various sizes can be reclaimed, then stacked in various patterns to fit the space that you have.Stack book crates on the side, rather than bottom-up, so you can stack your books as if they were in a bookshelf. This makes them easy to access and peruse.Think of it as a DIY bookshelf. Crates allow you to organize your books into micro genres, keeping your cookbooks in one crate and your novels in another, putting them in adjacent spaces and rooms if necessary. They're also movable.\n",
            "Store your children's books in wall-mounted theme bins.\n",
            "One creative idea with your stacks of children books is to purchase or fashion a wooden cut of an animal, dinosaur, or other kids-themed shape, and mount it on the wall. To it, affix small shelves or baskets in which you can store books at a child-appropriate height. This is a great way to lively up your kids' room and organize all their books.\n",
            "Shelve books according to genre.\n",
            "If you've got a lot of books, one of the most user-friendly ways to organize them is by genre. Keep your novels with your novels, your non-fiction with your non-fiction, and other genres together.[8] Get as specific as you want, for the books that you have.Within genre, you can specialize even further if you want to. In the history section, store your military history books together, but differentiate them from your natural history books, European history, and other sub-genres.If you don't have a lot of different genres, just split them into two big categories: Fun books and learning books. Put all novels, stories, and sci-fi in the first section. Put all your old school stuff in the other.\n",
            "Arrange your books by size and shape.\n",
            "Want to make sure your books look nice on the shelf? Group them according to their relative size and shape, to keep your shelves, stacks, or crates looking organized. Keep very tall and thin books with other very tall and thin books, and keep very squat and short books with other like books.Aside from looking nice and organized, books can be supported better if they're stacked next to books of a similar size. This helps to stabilize the covers and the binding.\n",
            "Arrange your books alphabetically.\n",
            "If you've got more of a linear mind, it might make more sense to you to categorize your books alphabetically, for easy reference. This may look a little more chaotic on the shelf, and you'll end up with some weird stuff next to one another, but you'll always know where everything is in the alphabet.Go by title, or go by the last name of the author when you're alphabetizing your books. Generally, titles are easier to remember, but you'll also end up with a lot of titles that start with \"The\" and \"A,\" which might be confusing.\n",
            "Arrange books by color.\n",
            "If you've got an eye for design, organizing your books according to the color of the binding can be an excellent way to give your room a pop of particular color, and make your book shelves really stand out. Group them according to specific colors and put them on the shelf in subtle gradations, moving from one color to the next.[9]Consult the color wheel to learn more about how to pick the right colors for interior decorating, books included.\n",

Try to eat mainly whole, unprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, etc.In addition, be sure to drink plenty of water each day. A good measure is to take your body weight in pounds and divide it in half: that's how much water you should drink each day in ounces. Example: if you weigh 180 pounds, you'll need to drink 90 ounces of water each day.\n",

Don't try to force yourself to be happy.Allow yourself to have a day off when you're really feeling low. If it's really bad, give yourself a couple of days, but promise yourself that no matter how you feel after 3 days are up, you'll get back to work/school and, if necessary, you'll get help.Remember that even if you make mistakes, you're still a whole, complete human being with inherent self-worth.[4]\n",

            "Sometimes the more you want something, the more difficult it is to get. The more you obsess over wanting to be happy, the more likely you are to focus on how unhappy you are. By placing pressure on yourself to be happy, you're more likely to achieve the opposite.Instead of pressuring yourself to be happy, acknowledge that it's your goal, and then do the things that will help you achieve it  for example, being mindful, being kind to yourself, and exercising regularly.It may help you to make an action plan of how you want to be happier in life.

You are the only person who can make yourself happy.Negative emotions tend to happen when you start resisting reality. You can't fix what you refuse to even think about.[5]Even if someone has done something hurtful to you, it does not benefit you to dwell too much on the pain. You can't control their actions, and you can't force them to make things better for you; you can only control your own actions and emotions.This may sound harsh, but it's actually very positive. It means that you are in control of your own happiness. Don't let someone else think they're in control. Don't give them that power!\n",

Combat negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Example: instead of saying, I am so stupid for failing that test, say I'll need to study harder next time or I am disappointed that I didn't pass that test; what can I do to ensure that I pass next time?If you can't find the good in something, avoid dwelling on the negativity.

Countless studies and spiritual gurus claim that the better we are at living in the moment, the happier we are.[7]To live in the moment, the first step is to develop a nonjudgmental awareness of yourself and the world around you: try observing your thoughts without judgment. Do not dwell on those thoughts or rush to push them away; simply let them be.[8]When you walk to the store to get groceries, don't focus on what you need to buy once you get there. Focus on how the ground feels beneath your feet; how the air feels against your skin; how it feels to breathe and walk; focus on the moment that you occupy right now.To increase your self-awareness, set 5 timers to go off throughout the day to remind you to evaluate your current emotions. By practicing naming your feelings, you'll hopefully begin to have more control over them.[9]Reader Poll: We asked 167 wikiHow readers for their preferred method for grounding themselves in the present to deal with negative feelings, and 48% of them said listening to calming music or sounds.

            "Be compassionate and empathetic toward others.\n",
            "To have compassion is to show concern for others; to have empathy is to put yourself in someone else's shoes. Research has linked depression and anxiety to a preoccupation with the self; being compassionate and empathetic broadens your perspective and helps you feel more connected to others.[10]One way in which you can build compassion toward others is through a loving-kindness meditation:[11]Sit comfortably, breathe in and out from your heart center (your chest area), and think or say these phrases several times: May I be free from inner and outer harm and danger. May I be safe and protected; May I be free of mental suffering or distress; May I be happy; May I be free of physical pain and suffering; May I be healthy and strong; May I be able to live in this world happily, peacefully, joyfully, with ease.Next, still sitting comfortably and breathing from your chest, move your thoughts to someone you love unconditionally, and send them the same good thoughts.After that, move on to a more neutral person, again reciting the words of loving-kindess, replacing the word I with their name.Finally, move on to someone you have difficulty with, or dislike, and again repeat the words of loving-kindess. If you have difficulty doing this, start each phrase with To the best of my ability I wish that you be\n",

Make curiosity a part of who you are, and you'll discover that life has a lot to offer.[12] Ways to foster curiosity:Explore your own thoughts and emotions. When you have a thought, don't just accept it as truth; be curious and ask yourself why you had that thought. You can do the same with others when they express ideas that are new to you or that you may not agree with.When you hear about something you don't know, look it up online, or ask someone to explain it to you.Instead of always eating the same food at your favourite restaurant, try something new  better yet, try a new restaurant!

            "Getting organized can help you feel more in control of your life. It involves anything from blocking out your time each day to cleaning up your home and getting rid of things you no longer need.[15]One great way to gain some control over your day-to-day life is to block out your time in an hourly diary:Choose a diary that shows your entire week over a two-page spread. Beneath each day there should be squares representing at least 12 hours of your day: from the time you wake up to the time you get home from work/school.At the start of each week, block out how you will spend your time each day. Start with the things you must get done and then move down your list in order of priority.Example: 7:00-7:10 a.m. Wake up; 7:10-7:45 do yoga; 7:45-8:30 shower/get dressed, 8:30-9:00 make/eat breakfast; 9:00-9:45 travel to work; 9:45-10:00 settle in; 10:30 check emails; 10:30-12:30 data entry; 12:30-1:30 lunch; and so on.Note that things will not always go as planned, and that's okay. What you block into your diary doesn't have to be set in stone; it's meant to be a guideline to help you gain some control over your time, and meet your goals.\n",

            "If you don't know what makes you happy, you probably won't be very happy. Explore new interests, socialize with people whose company you enjoy, note the things you like and don't like.Part of getting to know yourself could be keeping a daily journal. This will help you sort out your thoughts about things. Try to write in your journal every day - aim for three pages a day. Keep track of your feelings, likes and dislikes, successes etc.\n",

            "Life can begin to feel pretty dull if virtually all you do is eat, sleep, and work. Making an effort to get outside of that routine  for example through socializing or exploring new hobbies (ex., music, films, reading, art, sports)  will help you feel more fulfilled in life.Do things that make you laugh: see a funny movie, watch a comedy special on TV, hang out with funny people, play with a cat or dog, or do whatever it is that gets you laughing.

            "Be forgiving.\n",
            "If you hold on to anger about things that have happened in your past, you'll have trouble being happy. Forgive others and forgive yourself. This doesn't mean forgetting; it's more about letting go of anger. One doctor suggests the following exercise:[17]Identify someone you're angry with. Don't start with someone with whom you have deep-seated issues; start with someone who will likely be easier to forgive, like that person who cut you off in traffic the other day, or someone who pushed past you in the hallway at school, if you're still holding on to that.Get the anger out. Write your feelings down in a journal; discuss your feelings with friends, a therapist, or other supportive people. Work out whether you want to raise the issue with anyone.Picture the person in your mind, and ask yourself what they might have been dealing with on a person level, for them to have treated you that way. Putting yourself in their shoes will help you view them with more compassion, and may help you to forgive them.Note that this doesn't make their actions okay. You do not have to put up with people treating you poorly. The goal of the exercise is merely to help you release your anger about the event, so that you can move on and feel happier in life.\n",

            "How to Use Apostrophes: 10 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Use an apostrophe to indicate ownership by a proper noun.\n",
            "An apostrophe with an \"s\" after a proper noun indicates that the person, place or thing owns whatever noun follows his or her name.  For example, \"Mary's lemons.\" We know the lemons belong to Mary because of the 's. Other examples include \"China's foreign policy\" and \"the orchestra's conductor.\"[1]Ownership with certain proper nouns can be tricky. \"Sunday's football game\" is not technically correct (because Sunday is incapable of ownership) but it's perfectly acceptable to say and write. \"A hard day's work\" is likewise perfectly correct, even though the day is incapable of ownership.\n",
            "Be consistent when you use apostrophes after words that end in \"s.\n",
            "\" When someone's name ends with an \"s,\" it is acceptable to use an apostrophe without an \"s\" to show ownership, but linguists with the Chicago Manual of Style, along with others, prefer to add an \"s\" after the apostrophe.[2]Note the difference in usage:Acceptable: Jones' house; Francis' window; Enders' family.Preferred: Jones's house; Francis's window; Enders's family.Whichever style you prefer using, be consistent with it. It doesn't really matter which policy you adopt, as long as you adopt it consistently.\n",
            "Don't use an apostrophe to indicate ownership when using \"it\".\n",
            "\"China's foreign policy\" is correct, but say your reader already knows you're talking about China, and you start referring to the country as \"it.\"  If you were to reference something China owned in this way, you'd say \"its foreign policy.\"[3]The reason for this is to avoid confusion between \"its\" used for possession and \"it's\" used as a contraction of \"it is.\"   If you're not sure whether to use an apostrophe or not, try saying the sentence with \"it is\" or \"it has.\"  If it doesn't make sense (the way that \"it is foreign policy\" cannot substitute for \"China's foreign policy\"), then drop the apostrophe.\n",
            "Use apostrophes to indicate ownership by a plural noun.\n",
            "One common trip-up on apostrophe usage for a plural group occurs when people want to discuss what a family owns.  For instance, say the Smart family lives across the street from you and owns a boat.  The boat is \"the Smarts' boat,\" not \"the Smart's boat.\"  Because you are talking about all of the members of the Smart family, you would start with \"Smarts.\"  Because all the Smarts (presumably) own the boat, you add the apostrophe after the \"s.\"[4]If the family's last name ends in \"s,\" make it plural before adding an apostrophe.  For instance, if you wanted to discuss the Williams family, they would become \"the Williamses\" in a plural sense.  If you wanted to reference their dog, you'd say \"the Williamses' dog.\"   If the last name seems awkward to say that way, sidestep the issue by saying \"the Williams family\" and \"the Williams family's dog.\"If you're listing who owns an object, know where to put the apostrophe.  For instance, if both John and Mary own a cat, you would write \"John and Mary's cat\"  not \"John's and Mary's cat.\"  \"John and Mary\" is a cohesive noun phrase, and therefore only needs one apostrophe.\n",
            "In general, don't use an apostrophe to indicate a plural.\n",
            "The wrong use of an apostrophe to form the plural is called the greengrocer's apostrophe, since grocers are often the worst (or at least the most visible) offenders.[5]  If you have more than one apple, then write apples, not apple's.An occasional exception to this use is in the case of making a single letter plural.  Therefore, Why are there so many i's in the word \"indivisibility\"? is correct, depending on who you ask. This is simply for clarity reasons, so the reader does not mistake it for the word \"is.\"  However, in modern usage, the preference is to avoid inserting an apostrophe and instead surround the single letter in quotation marks before pluralizing it: Why are there so many \"i\"s in the word \"indivisibility\"?Avoid the problem altogether with small numbers by spelling out the word: \"ones\" instead of \"1's,\" \"fours\" instead of \"4's\" or \"nines\" instead of \"9's.\" Only spell out words of numerals that are ten or lower.\n",
            "Know how to use apostrophes for acronyms and years.\n",
            "Say you use an acronym for a noun, like CD.  To make CD plural, use \"CDs,\" not CD's.\"  The same logic goes for years  instead of writing \"Spandex was popular in the 1980's,\" use \"1980s.\"[6]The only time an apostrophe should be used in a year is if it's standing in for omitted numbers.  For instance, if you wanted to shorten the year 2005, you could write '05.  In this case, the apostrophe is essentially acting like it does in a contraction and serving as shorthand.\n",
            "Use apostrophes in contractions.\n",
            "Sometimes, especially in informal writing, apostrophes are used to indicate one or more missing letters.  For example, the word \"don't\" is short for \"do not\"; other examples include \"isn't,\" \"wouldn't,\" and \"can't.\"  Contractions can also be made with the verbs \"is,\" \"has,\" and \"have.\"  For example, we can write \"She's going to school\" instead of \"She is going to school\"; or \"He's lost the game\" instead of \"He has lost the game.\"[7]\n",
            "Be aware of the its/it's trap.\n",
            "Use an apostrophe with the word \"it\" only when you want to indicate a contraction for \"it is\" or \"it has.  It is a pronoun, and pronouns have their own possessive form that does not use an apostrophe.[8]  For example, \"That noise?  It's just the dog eating its bone.\"  This may seem confusing, but it follows the same pattern as other possessive pronouns: his, hers, its, yours, ours, theirs.[9]\n",
            "Avoid using contractions that don't exist.\n",
            "Many people use informal contractions such as \"shouldn't've\" or \"'ought.\" These contractions aren't real contractions, so avoid using them in formal writing. Another mistake to avoid is using people's names in contractions. For example, if you use \"Bob's\" as a contraction of \"Bob is,\" then that's not correct. \"Bob's\" is supposed to be a possessive, not a contraction. It's okay to use pronouns in contractions such as \"he's\" or \"she's.\"\n",
            "When writing in cursive, always connect letters after an apostrophe to the rest of the word.\n",

            "How to Stop Eye Twitching: Quick Fixes and Simple Solutions\n",
            "Gently rub your eye and the muscles surrounding it.\n",
            "Use 2-3 fingers to lightly rub your eye. Then, massage the muscles and skin around your eyebrow and cheek. Do this for 30-60 seconds and see if the twitching stops. Like any part of your body, the tiny muscles and nerves around your eye can get irritated or knotted. A massage might help your eyes relax and make your eye stop twitching immediately.[1]Ever had your foot fall asleep or get a knot in your back? A twitchy left or right eye is a similar type of issue.\n",
            "If strain is the cause of your twitch, blinking may fix things.\n",
            "Shut your eyes as tight as you can. Then, open them up as wide as possible. This flexes the muscles around your eyes. If youve got some kind of muscle strain, this is the facial equivalent of stretching it out![2]If your eye twitches when youre looking at a screen for a long period of time, you probably arent blinking often enough. Take more breaks and try to remember to blink more often.\n",
            "A little heat will soothe your eye muscle and stop the twitching.\n",
            "Grab a heating pad and turn it to the lowest setting possible. Leave it on your eye for 5-10 minutes at a time and take frequent breaks. The heat will help your eye muscles relax and put an end to the twitching.[3]If you dont have a heating pad, soak a clean cloth in warm water and use that.\n",
            "Your eye may be twitching because its dry and irritated.\n",
            "If youve been around dust, you have allergies, or youve just been up for a while, you may need to lubricate your eyes. Grab any commercial eye drop, tilt your head back, and apply 2-3 drops directly to your eyeball. Your twitching may stop immediately![4]If you find yourself needing to use eye drops regularly, see your doctor. Persistently dry eyes are a sign you may have an underlying medical condition.\n",
            "If you arent getting 8 hours of sleep a night, start now.\n",
            "Rest is one of natures best remedies. General fatigue can lead to dry, tired eyes and result in more occurrences of eye twitching. Try to get a full 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Also, limit your use of electronic screens such as TVs, mobile devices, and computer screens leading up to bedtime, since those can mess with your sleep cycle.[5]Improve your sleep hygiene by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day and blocking all light out of your room. Regular exercise helps, too![6]If the twitching is going on right now and youre tired, take a nap!\n",
            "Stick with water to see if that fixes your twitch.\n",
            "Both caffeine and alcohol can irritate your facial muscles if you consume too much. Alcohol dehydrates you, which is a common cause of muscle spasms, while caffeine naturally makes people twitchy. Try taking it easy with the coffee, tea, and/or alcohol. Your twitch will likely go away on its own.[7]Stimulants, like Adderall, can also cause an eye twitch if you dont take the prescription as directed.\n",
            "Stress and anxiety release neurotransmitters that cause twitching.\n",
            "If youve got a lot on your plate, finding a way to relax and engage in some self-care will not only minimize your twitching, but help you deal with the stress in your life.[8] You might take up yoga or learn to meditate. On top of that, try to set aside some time every day to pursue your hobbies and do things you enjoy.[9]Regular exercise helps dramatically. If you can get active, run, or play sports, youll find it a lot easier to cope with stress.\n",
            "Dehydration can cause your muscles to tighten up.\n",
            "Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.[10] Aim to drink 11.5-15.5 cups (2.7-3.7 L) of water every day to keep your body healthy and happy.[11]If you notice your eye twitches often after heavy workout sessions or when its hot out, you likely need to drink more water.\n",
            "Eye twitching is a common side effect of a bunch of different meds.\n",
            "If youre taking prescription medication, ask your doctor if any of them could be causing eye twitching. This is a surprisingly common side effect, and your doctor may be able to offer an alternative medication that wont make you twitch.[12]This is a common side effect for a lot of epilepsy and Parkinson meds.[13]Certain migraine medications can also cause your eye to twitch.[14]\n",
            "If the twitching just wont go away, ask your doctor about Botox.\n",
            "Uncontrolled eye twitching is called blepharospasm, and its extremely common. Luckily, the occasional botulinum toxin (Botox) injection can keep your twitches from acting up. Botox will keep the twitching muscle from moving, which will completely prevent your tic from coming back for at least a few months.[15]Botox might sound like kind of a radical remedy to an eye twitch, but these injections are really no big deal. Doctors administer Botox all the time for everything from lazy eye to bladder dysfunction. This is a very mundane procedure these days.\n",
            "Seek help if you experience any other symptoms, as well.\n",
            "Eye twitching is almost always a non-issue, but there are a few reasons to see a doctor if the tic wont stop. This is especially important if you experience facial weakness, drooping, or your eyes start to turn red. Also, see a doctor if your vision changes at all (i.e. double vision, light sensitivity). Its probably nothing, but its better to be safe than sorry.[16]Common mundane causes of an eye twitch include blepharitis (inflamed eyelids) or hemifacial spasms.In extremely rare cases, the twitching may be a sign of a nerve disorder or a neurological issue.\n",

            "Select the material you wish to use.\n",
            "Pieces of material used in mosaic art are called tesserae.  They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or whatever else you can find.[1]  You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include.  These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc.[2][3][4]If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes.  This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later.Choose a wide variety of colors and shades.  Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones.Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create.  For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells.  If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals.\n",
            "Pick the foundation to adhere the mosaic tiles on.\n",
            "Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use.[5]  You can make almost anything work as a base.  Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base.  Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout. [6]Choose bases which have large, open spaces and that are solid.[7] If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit.\n",
            "Clean your base appropriately.\n",
            "Every base needs to be cleaned off before you adhere the mosaic tiles down, otherwise they will not stick properly.  For most bases, you can simply use water and a basic home cleaner.  Scrub the dirt and grim off, and then dry the surface off.  Go back over the surface a few more times in case you missed something.[8][9]For metal bases, use sandpaper and a wire brush in order to remove rust.  The now \"roughed up\" surface has an added benefit, it will make the tiles stick to the surface better.Score plastic and/or rubber surfaces with a utility knife in order to help the tiles stick better.Sand wood surfaces down, then apply a waterproof sealer.  If you don't do this, moisture could soak in, thereby cracking your mosaic art.\n",
            "Find a pattern you wish to make into a mosaic.\n",
            "Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design.  For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern.  This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes.  After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects.[10][11]\n",
            "Transfer the design to your base.\n",
            "Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed.  Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil.  This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies.  Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base.  If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design.[12][13]If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections.  Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles.If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base.  However, don't over plan.  Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art.\n",
            "Cut your mosaic objects into pieces.\n",
            "In order to get the mosaic \"look\" you will need to create different shapes and sizes of pieces.  Remember, before you begin to break your mosaic objects into pieces, you need to be wearing safety goggles, gloves, and an apron.  Pick a safe place to cut your objects, like an empty garage, or outdoors in your backyard.  If you are just looking to make randomly sized pieces, a basic hammer works best.  However, there are some more specialized ways.[14] [15]Tile nippers and cutters are used to create straight lines and curves.[16]  They can be found at most hardware, and arts and crafts stores.  These are used to cut through porcelain, ceramic, china, etc.  Cut through the object you are using about halfway through.  They, using your hands, break the piece off.Glass nippers and cutters work the same way, except that they are specially designed for cutting glass.When you are creating the pieces, look at your design.  Try to envision what shapes you will need in order to fill the pattern.  If you miss a piece, or mis-cut one, you can always come back later to cut a new one.\n",
            "Lay your mosaic tesserae overtop of the pattern.\n",
            "Take each of your new pieces you have created and place them where you will eventually stick them.  This is a great opportunity to mix around shapes, sizes and colors.  Once you get a basic layout of your pieces, find where the missing pieces are, or where you need a better shaped piece.  Then go back and create a new one which better fits the design.[17][18]Once you have your objects laid out the way you want them, you then have two options: leave them there, or take them off.If you choose to leave them there, you will apply mortar directly to the pieces.  This garners a more accurate design, but takes a lot longer and can be more tricky.If you choose to take them off, place the pieces to the side in the same pattern they were placed on the base.  You will be applying mortar onto the base.  This garners a less accurate pattern, but is much easier to accomplish.\n",
            "Mix together a mortar mixture.\n",
            "You can find mortar mixtures at most local hardware stores.  You will want to mix together 2-3 cups of mortar mixture with an acrylic admix.  Stir the mixture together until the consistency is like thick cottage cheese.  Only mix together small amounts as you work, as the mortar mixture cannot be preserved.[19]\n",
            "Apply your mortar mixture.\n",
            "Depending on whether you have left the pattern on, or taken it off, will change whether you apply the mortar to the pieces or the base, respectively.  Use a small knife or scalpel.  When you are applying the mortar, wear gloves so that mortar does not stick to your hands.  Mortar is basically a type of cement which can be difficult to get off.[20] If you are applying the mixture to the base, only do one section at a time.  Spread on a few inches, length wise, onto the base.  You only need about a 1/4 inch width of mortar.If you are applying it to the pieces themselves, take your knife and apply the mixture to the back of the piece.  Try to keep most of the mortar adhered to the back by gently pressing the mixture with your hands.  Scrape off excess mortar from around the outside edge of the piece before you apply it.\n",
            "Affix your pieces to the base.\n",
            "While still wet, gently affix the mosaic tiles by pushing them down onto the base.  Apply tiles starting in one corner of the design and work across in rows.  Make sure you leave enough space between pieces for grout, about 1/8 inch gaps.  Every time you lay down a new piece, scrape off any excess mortar which is readily apparent.  If you don't, the mortar will solidify and be hard to get off.[21][22]\n",
            "Let the mortar set.\n",
            "Time varies depending on usage, so follow manufacturer recommendations.  For pieces in your home, the timing is roughly 24 hours.  Outdoor mosaics will need to set for 72 hours.  Clean the mosaic tiles once more to clear away any extra mortar that may have risen to the top.\n",
            "Prepare the grout mixture.\n",
            "[23]  Combine together 2-3 cups of grout mixture with a bit of acrylic admix.  Stir the combination until the consistency is that of thick cottage cheese.  Grout comes in many colors and there are colors you can add to the grout to change the coloring.  Choose a color that accents your mosaic.[24][25]\n",
            "Apply the grout using a spatula.\n",
            "[26]  Fill in the creases between the tiles. The grout should cover the mosaic enough to fill the gaps.  Work in small areas at a time and wipe off any excess grout as you go along.  Each time you grout around a new piece, give the tesserae a gentle push to make sure the tile sticks to the grout.[27]Make sure you are wearing gloves as you apply, otherwise the grout will stick and solidify on your hands.\n",
            "Let the grout set between 24-48 hours.\n",
            "Wipe the mosaic with a clean sponge and warm water.  Rinse out the sponge regularly as you wipe away grout from the surface of the tiles.  After you are done cleaning, let the water sit in the bucket for a while.  The grout will sink to the bottom.  You can then pour out the water, and dump the grout into a trashcan.[28][29]\n",
            "Seal the mosaic with varnish.\n",
            "This will coat the tiles and safeguard against damage, especially for outdoor mosaics subjected to fluctuating temperatures and adverse weather conditions.  It also will give a high gloss shine that will make the colors stand out.  Tile and stone-floor sealers can be purchased at most local hardware stores.[30][31]You will want to apply two coats.  Use a paintbrush to apply each coat.  In between coats, wait about 10-15 minutes for the varnish to dry.After the sealer has dried, buff the mosaic with a soft towel.  This will give your mosaic a nice clean finish.Reapply every few years for added protection.\n",
            "Create an edging for your mosaic.\n",
            "This is strictly optional, but can add a level of dimension to your work, especially if it is a tile or table.  You can affix pieces of tesserae to the edges using the same mortar and grout steps.  Another great option is the paint the edges using an acrylic paint.  You can also pack grout onto the edges, using a spatula, for a more textured look.\n",

            "Prune the bush between April and June.\n",
            "Its best to wait until after the flowering season to ensure that the branches are producing blooms. After the plant blooms, look for branches that didn't produce any leaves or flowers.[1]Avoid trimming the plant during the blooming season, as this can halt growth and cause the flowers to wilt prematurely.Disinfect your pruning shears with rubbing alcohol or bleach before using them to reduce the spread of pests and diseases.\n",
            "Remove any branches that are dead, damaged, or diseased.\n",
            "Look around the bush for any dead branches that have no leaves or didnt produce blooms. Make note of areas where branches have snapped or bent. Around the bottom of the plant, look for any branches that have bugs on them or have wilted leaves.[2]Cut infected and broken branches before shaping the bush by removing healthy branches.\n",
            "Hold the pruning scissors at a 45-degree angle.\n",
            "Cutting at an angle helps water run off the end and prevents the chances of stem rot. Try not to cut branches straight across, as this can kill the rest of the branch because water will pool on the surface, and it invites pests to burrow into the branches.[3]Always use sharp pruning scissors or long-handled loppers to prevent minuscule cracks from forming in the branches.\n",
            "Cut the branches 14in (0.64cm) in front of a bud.\n",
            "Leaving a tiny bit of the old branch will encourage regrowth. To find a bud, look for an area where a leaf or another branch meets the branch that you want to cut. This is an area where growth occurs.[4]If any part of the branch is extremely damaged or diseased, cut it back to a healthy main branch at the center of the bush, also called a parent branch.\n",
            "Remove a few branches from the middle to increase light and airflow.\n",
            "Select some of the long, healthy stems in the middle portion of the bush, and prune them to a bud near the center of the bush. This will allow more sunshine and air to penetrate into the middle and lower part of the bush, encouraging further growth.[5]Avoid removing more than  of the healthy branches on your bush at any time, even if it is overgrown.If you have a lot of long branches at the top of the bush, you may want to trim some of those to the center of the bush. This can also increase the amount of sunshine that reaches the lower part of the shrub.\n",

            "Pull off or trim any dead stems and wilted flowers before pruning.\n",
            "Use your hands or pruning scissors to remove any remaining brown leaves or flowers from the vine before you begin to shape it. This will give you a better idea of the size and shape of your vine and can draw your attention to areas where the vine needs more water, sunlight, or airflow.[7]If one area has a lot of dead leaves, prune around the area with your scissors to increase light and air flow to that part of the vine.\n",
            "Remove tangled stems at the top of the vine.\n",
            "The top portion of the vine tends to be more tangled than the bottom, and cutting off stems here promotes growth later in the season. Cut only the tangled stems, and work slowly at the bottom of the vine.[8]If you want to redirect the vine, trim more off of one side of the plant to encourage growth in the opposite direction.Avoid trimming any stems from the bottom of younger plants, as this old growth tends to support the plant. Without it, the vine might die.\n",
            "Use a pair of sharp pruning scissors to cut just above a leaf node.\n",
            "Leaf nodes are the part of a stem where the leaf begins to form from a parent stem. Hold your scissors at a 45-degree angle at the node, and make a clean cut all the way across the stem.[9]No matter where youre cutting, use this technique to prevent diseases and pests from overtaking the vine.\n",
            "Wait until the winter to prune overgrown honeysuckle.\n",
            "During the winter, the honeysuckle bushes and vines are dormant, and more severe pruning wont harm the plant. Aim for early winter to avoid the flowering period, but pruning in late winter is also acceptable, as long as the plant does not have any new growth.[10]Pruning in the winter also tends to increase flowering in the following years because the branches can heal completely before blooming.Avoid severely pruning honeysuckle more than 1 time every 2-3 winters. Over pruning could kill the bush.\n",
            "Cut severely overgrown plants within 1ft (0.30m) of the ground.\n",
            "Using a hand saw or loppers, trim all of the stems so that just 1ft (0.30m) of growth remains.

            "Put on a comfortable, well-fitting, non-padded bra.\n",
            "Choose the bra you feel most comfortable in--it should be snug but not dig into your sides.[1] Your nipples should be about halfway between your elbow and shoulder. If they are lower, tighten the straps to lift.[2]You can also measure without a bra, but it may be slightly more challenging when things can move around.\n",
            "Find your band size.\n",
            "Standing in front of a mirror, use a soft tape measurer to measure around your ribs right under your breasts. This is also where the band of your bra wraps around your torso. Pull the tape tight. Write down this measurement.[3]Use the mirror to make sure the tape is exactly parallel to the floor. If the measuring tape is not in a straight line around your body and at an angle, you will not get an accurate measurement.[4]Don't pull the tape so tight it's like you are wearing a corset. Just make sure it is squeezing your body snugly.[5]If your measurement is a fraction (like 33 1/2 inches), round up to the nearest whole number (34 inches).[6]Band sizes are measured in even numbers, so if your measurement was odd, you may want to try one size up and one size down (if you measure 35 inches, try both the 34 and the 36 size bra), but round up for now.[7]\n",
            "Find your bust size.\n",
            "Wrap the measuring tape around your back and measure your breasts at their fullest point, usually at the nipple.[8] Write down this measurement.Because your cup size can fluctuate based on hormones and bloating, try to measure on a day when your breasts feel relatively normal.[9]If you are concerned about your posture (maybe you slouch), try bending forward at the hips to a 90 degree angle, or until your body forms an L shape. Then measure your bust from that position.[10]Don't pull the tape tight like you did with your band measurement.As with the band measurement, round up to the nearest whole number if your measurement is a fraction.[11]Again, be certain the tape is straight across your back. The measuring tape should not angle up from your back toward your nipples.All women have one breast that is larger than the other, so be sure you are measuring to the fuller breast.[12]\n",
            "Subtract your band size from your bust size.\n",
            "The difference between these two numbers is your key to finding your cup size. A 1 inch (2.5cm) difference = A cup. 2 inch (5.1cm) = B cup. 3 inch = C cup. 4 inch (10.2cm) = D cup. 5 inch = DD cup.[13]Once you go above 5 inches (12.7cm), cup sizes will differ with each company. There should be a sizing chart on the company's website and you can use your band and bust measurement to find which cup you want.[14]\n",
            "Combine the cup size with your band measurement, and you have your final bra size.\n",
            "So, a 34C means you have a 34 inch (86.4cm) band and a C cup.\n",
            "Remember that the cup size is not the same for each band size.\n",
            "A 34B cup will be smaller than a 36B cup. When trying on bras, if you change band sizes you, will also have to change cup sizes.If you need a larger band size, go down a cup size. So instead of 34B, you'll want 36A.If you need a smaller band size, go up a cup size. Instead of 34B, go for 32C.It is more important to have an accurate band measurement than cup measurement. Going up or down a band size is a more significant change than going up or down a cup size. Get a comfortable band first and then fine tune with the cup size.[15]\n",

A low-impact bra works great for yoga or hiking. A high-impact bra is necessary for activities like running.[26]Smaller-breasted women are usually comfortable in compression bras (that give the appearance of a \"unibreast\") and look like a cropped tank top.For larger-breasted women, an bra that cups and encapsulates each breast may be more comfortable and inhibit bouncing. These bras have wide straps and clasps.[27]You may also find a bra that combines compression and encapsulation, which will give you the best support overall.[28]\n",

            "Learn the fundamentals of reflexology.\n",
            "Reflexology is based on the premise that the nerves in your feet, hands and ears each correspond with other parts of your body. Applying pressure to certain reflex areas can relieve symptoms in other parts of the body. Engaging a nerve in your big toe, for example, could reduce tension in your head and relieve a headache.[1] Applying pressure to your heel could aid in digestion. Reflexology has even been used to aid in treatment for serious conditions like cancer, diabetes and heart disease.[2] Research has shown that reflexology has four primary effects:It can impact specific organs, such as by increasing blood flow to the kidneys.It can bring about an amelioration of specific symptoms by helping organs function properly.It can create a relaxation effect and reduce anxiety.It can relieve pain throughout the body.\n",
            "Understand reflexology zones.\n",
            "Reflexology is based on the idea that the body can be divided into zones. Picture your body divided into a system of longitudinal and transverse zones. Imagine five zones on each side of your body, starting at the tip of each toe, and running up the length of your body to the top of your head. The transverse zones (similar to lines of latitude) divide the areas of your feet into zones that correspond to your head and neck, your chest, abdomen and your pelvis area. Engaging the tip of a particular zone by applying pressure to a place on the foot activates the body's healing power for that entire zone. This concept is also referred to as zone therapy.When you perform reflexology, it's necessary to learn where the reflexes are on the feet that correspond to every limb, organ and gland of your body. When you apply pressure to these specific points, you stimulate the corresponding limb, organ or gland.In this way you can use reflexology to stimulate your body's healing power. When your body is experiencing stress, your energy reserves get depleted and you are less able to fight infections or combat pain. But when your body is in a deeply relaxed state induced by reflexology, your bodys natural healing power is activated.\n",
            "Consider making an appointment with a reflexologist.\n",
            "Meeting with a person who has been certified in the art of reflexology is a good way to introduce yourself to the practice. He or she will be able to show you the finger \"walking\" techniques used to apply pressure to specific points on the hands, feet and ears to relieve stress and pain in other parts of the body.Before making an appointment, be sure to check the person's credentials and verify that he or she is a certified reflexologist. Some natural health practitioners practice reflexology without having studied the art in depth.If you're interested in  becoming a reflexologist, consult the website of the American Reflexology Certification Board to find a list of programs that offer certification in reflexology.\n",
            "Practice applying pressure to reflex points.\n",
            "When you identify which zone you want to engage, find the correct reflex spots on your foot by looking on a chart or consulting with a reflexologist. Apply gentle pressure to the area. The pressure you apply to these spots will stimulate your body to create endorphins that interrupt the pain cycle and relieve stress.Reflexology feels similar to getting a foot massage. The pressure you apply should feel firm, but not painful. Use your fingers and thumbs to gently work the area for several minutes.To prepare yourself for a reflexology session, simply try to relax. Reflexology is often considered a holistic healing practice, but there's no special mental preparation you have to go through to make it effective.[3]\n",
            "Get in a comfortable position.\n",
            "Remove your shoes and socks and sit cross-legged on a bed or a yoga mat. Try to relax your body in an effort to prepare yourself to begin the healing process. You may either perform your own reflexology treatment or work with a partner who can apply pressure in the spots that are more difficult to reach.\n",
            "Relieve tension in your neck and head.\n",
            "Relieve neck tension by applying pressure to the joints or \"necks\" of your 8 little toes. If you are experiencing tension in one area of your neck, you will feel tension or a slight discomfort in one of your corresponding toes. Your entire head is represented in your two big toes, so apply pressure to them to relieve headache tension.Use your fingers to apply steady, firm pressure to the backs of your toes, one at a time.Continue until you feel the tension in your neck begin to dissolve and the pressure leave your head.\n",
            "Help your chest relax.\n",
            "Stress often manifests in the form of a chest that feels tight. You may feel like you're having trouble taking a good, deep breath. Apply pressure to the balls of your feet to alleviate chest discomfort. This area contains the reflexes to your lungs, airways, heart, thymus gland, chest and shoulders.\n",
            "Relieve stomach tension.\n",
            "If you tend to feel stress in your stomach, which many might describe as having \"the jitters,\" press the reflex points on your instep (the non-weight bearing area on the bottom of your foot) to relieve discomfort to your abdominal organs. This is the area you would want to work on if you are feeling \"gut-wrenching\" emotions, or if you wake up with a feeling of heaviness in the pit of your stomach.\n",
            "Loosen your limbs.\n",
            "If your legs, arms and shoulders feel tight with stress, use reflexology to loosen up. Discharge tension in your arms and legs by applying pressure to the reflex points on the outer edges of your feet.\n",
            "Help yourself sleep.\n",
            "Try applying pressure to a combination of all of the reflex points to relieve insomnia.[4] Stress is often the main cause behind insomnia, and if worries, fears and tension tend to keep you up at night, you can relieve your insomnia using the same reflex points you would use to relieve tension and stress:Apply pressure to the backs of your toes to ease pressure in your neck and head.Apply pressure to the balls of your feet to help you breathe more easily.Apply pressure to your instep to help your stomach calm down.Apply pressure to the outer edges of your feet to loosen tight muscles.\n",
            "Have a partner help you.\n",
            "When you're dealing with pain, it can be helpful to work with a partner rather than performing reflexology techniques on your own. That way you can try to completely relax your body to allow healing to begin. Remove constricting clothing and lie down on a bed or another comfortable surface before beginning the session.Dim the lights to create a more peaceful environment with as few irritating stimulants as possible.It can help to play soothing music, light some candles, or use massage oil to make the experience feel as calming and healing as possible.\n",
            "Get rid of a headache.\n",
            "Reflexology is great for relieving simple headaches and neck tension. Relieve tension and sinus headaches by applying pressure on the reflex points for the head and neck, which are located on your toes. All of your toes have points that correlate to your head, face and brain.[5]Apply pressure to the entire surface of each of your toes if you are suffering from a migraine headache. Press your thumb into each toe and repeat the process at least ten times for each toe. This method is especially effective if your migraine has been triggered by sinusitis.If you have chronic or unexplained head pain, seek medical advice to find out if your headaches are being triggered by other medical conditions.\n",
            "Deal with general aches and pains.\n",
            "An overall reflexology session can relieve general aches and pains. Most reflex points should be pressed for about 10 seconds at a time. Take your time and press all the reflex points on each one of your feet. Use light pressure and pay attention to any spot that feels sore or painful. When you experience discomfort in a reflex point, the corresponding organ or limb is out of balance.Treat all the reflex points on each foot, to evaluate all your areas of imbalance.Once youve worked on each of your feet, return to any painful points and work your sore points gently until you no longer feel the soreness or discomfort.\n",

            "Give them ibuprofen or aspirin.\n",
            "Painful cramps are a common side-effect of periods, and ibuprofen or aspirin can help reduce the discomfort. If they don't already have some, go to a drugstore and pick up a bottle of their preferred pain reliever. Ask them if they want any, and if they say no, just leave it on a kitchen counter where they'll see it later.[1]They can either take 400 mg of ibuprofen (Motrin/Advil) or 600 mg of aspirin every four to six hours as needed.\n",
            "Offer them a heating pad.\n",
            "If your loved one prefers natural remedies over medication, offer a heating pad to place over the lower abdomen to ease cramps. You can purchase disposable heating pads at the drugstore, or make a reusable one by filling a sock with rice and tying off the end.[2]Heat the rice-filled sock for one to two minutes in the microwave.Homemade heating pads shouldn't be left on for more than 30 minutes at a time, but store-bought disposable heating pads can often be left on for up to eight hours.\n",
            "Pick out fiber-rich foods.\n",
            "People can sometimes become constipated while menstruating, so cook food or offer snacks that have lots of fiber in them. Offer raspberries, pears, broccoli, lentils, brown rice, and whole grain cereals, but dont insist they eat them if they don't want to. If they're craving more carb-heavy foods, make a whole grain waffle with sliced fruit on top.[3]\n",
            "Steer clear of salty foods and alcohol.\n",
            "Some foods will make dehydration, bloating, and other period symptoms worse. If you're the one cooking or shopping, avoid picking up alcohol or salty foods like potato chips or french fries unless the person asks for them. Make sure to have plenty of healthy food options available. [4]\n",
            "Encourage them to drink more water.\n",
            "Dehydration can make abdominal cramps worse, so make sure they always have water within reach. Refill their water bottle when you see it getting low, or just fill up a glass and place it on a coffee or side table before sitting down to watch TV together.[5]\n",
            "Give them a massage.\n",
            "Offering them a back rub or a foot massage will help relieve some of their bodily aches while also showing that you still want to be near them. Ask if they'd like a massage, but dont be offended if they say no. They may simply not want to be touched for a while.[6]\n",
            "Go on a walk together.\n",
            "While they may not feel like exercising, physical activity can actually reduce many symptoms of PMS. Rather than suggesting they go to the gym, ask if they'd like to go for a walk with you.[7]\n",
            "Be mature about their symptoms.\n",
            "Dont make jokes about their behaviors and symptoms, and dont make it obvious if menstruation makes you uncomfortable. They may want to talk about what they're going through, or they might not. Wait for them to bring it up, and if they do, be mature throughout the conversation, asking questions about their symptoms only as they relate to their well-being.[8]Listen to any complaints they have about their period, and then tell them youre sorry they have to go through this.If you also menstruate, you can support your partner by sharing what helps you personally during those rough weeks. Try not to make the conversation all about you; instead, focus on how to make your partner feel better.Never use words like crazy or insane to describe their behaviors during this time. They may be more emotional due to hormone shifts, but they are no less intelligent or rational than they were before.\n",
            "Ask them if they want to be alone.\n",
            "During various points throughout the week, they may want to curl up with you on the couch, or they may want to be home alone. Dont assume you know what they want. Ask in a nonjudgmental tone if they just want some space for a day or two. If not, stick around as much as possible so they don't feel isolated.[9]If they do want to be alone, respect their wishes. But also show them youre still thinking about them by sending them a sweet text or email while youre apart.\n",
            "Reduce social activities.\n",
            "They likely wont be in the mood to socialize much when they're on their period, so dont pressure them into going out with you during this time. Instead, order their favorite take-out and watch a movie together at home. If they're more tired than usual, suggest you both go to bed early.[10]If youre close enough to be able to keep track of their cycle, avoid planning any big activities or events around the week of their period. Camping or beach trips should be avoided, as should fancy events where they'll need to get dressed up.\n",
            "Take on more household chores and errands.\n",
            "If their menstrual cramps are severe, they may not be physically able to do much around the house. Pick up the slack by washing dishes, doing laundry, buying groceries, cooking, and keeping things tidy. Even if they're not in a lot of pain, seeing you do these things will make them feel loved and appreciated.[11]\n",
            "Compliment her.\n",
            "People often feel bloated and unattractive during menstruation. A few compliments can go a long way toward making them feel more confident. Dont overdo it by gushing about how great they look, but find little ways to slip compliments in.For example, if a sappy commercial on TV makes them cry, tell them you love how kind and caring they are.If they don't want to go out, tell them how relaxing it is to stay home with them.\n",
            "Be patient.\n",
            "This can be a tough time both for them and for you. Dont lose your temper if you think they're being unreasonable, and dont run for the hills because you want to avoid it altogether. Take deep breaths when they're behaving in a way you dont understand, and know that it will pass. Most periods only last between three and five days, but for some people it can last up to a week.[12]Practice meditation once or twice a day to help calm any frustration you may be feeling.\n",

            "Decide what you really want to achieve.\n",
            "Don't be concerned about what others want for you.  Make your goals for yourself.[1] Studies show that when your goals are personally meaningful, youre more likely to get ahead in life and achieve them.[2]Oftentimes, this is the hardest part of the goal-making and fulfilling process. What do you want? The answer to this is often a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Buzz phrases like stay true to yourself clash with familial and work obligations. Find goals that promote a balance in your life - goals that make you happy and benefit your loved ones and others that depend on you.Consider asking yourself some questions, such as What do I want to offer my family/community/world? or How do I want to grow? These questions can help you determine the direction to take.[3]Its okay if your ideas are fairly broad at this point. Youll narrow them down next.\n",
            "Prioritize.\n",
            "Once you have an idea of what you really want to achieve, you need to prioritize these areas. Trying to work on every area of your life at once can leave you overwhelmed and unable to achieve any of your goals.[4]Split your goals into three areas: first, second, and third tier. The first-tier goals are the most important to you, and they may come more naturally. The second and third tier goals are not as important. They may also be more limited or specific.For example, first tier goals could be improve my health or spend more time with my family. Second tier goals could be keep my room clean, learn to surf and third tier goals could be learn to knit, do laundry more regularly.\n",
            "Set specific goals.\n",
            "Be specific and realistic about what it is that you want to achieve.[5] Research shows that setting a specific goal makes you more likely to achieve it and can even make you feel happier in general. Be as specific and detailed as possible, remembering that you may need to break large goals into smaller sub-goals.[6]Ask yourself some questions about your goals. What do you need to do to achieve them? Who will need to assist you? When will each stage of your goal need to be accomplished?For example, Be healthier is too big and vague to be a helpful goal. Eat better and exercise more is better, but its still not detailed or specific.Eat 3 servings of fruit and vegetables a day and exercise 3 times a week is specific and concrete, making it much easier to achieve.You also need to build the scaffolding for how you will achieve these goals. For example, to achieve your fruit and veg goals, will you bring healthy snacks along to work? Choose a fruit cup instead of fries the next time you eat out? For exercising, will you work out at the gym or go for walks in your neighborhood? Think about the individual actions you need to take to add up to your overall goal.If you have multiple stages for your goals, when does each need to be accomplished? For example, if youre training for a marathon, you need to have an idea of how long each stage of training will take you.\n",
            "Be realistic.\n",
            "Setting the concrete, specific goal of Buy a 3-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side wont help you if your budget is more Studio apartment in Brooklyn. Keep your goals grounded in reality. Its okay to have aspirational goals, but you need to know exactly what to do to get you there.[7]For example, if your ultimate goal is to buy a big house in the country, you will need multiple sub-goals to accomplish this. Youll need to save up money, build your credit, even possibly increase your income. Write out each of these sub-goals, along with the steps to take for each.\n",
            "Write out your goals.\n",
            "Be detailed, be clear, and include your deadlines. Writing them down tends to make them feel a little more real. Keep your list in a place where you can reference them frequently. This will help keep you motivated. Word your goals positively. Youre much more likely to achieve your goals when they are worded in positive ways, such as Eat more fruits and vegetables instead of Stop eating junk food. another example of this is \"Exercise more often\" instead of \"Sit around less\".[8]\n",
            "Make sure your goal is measurable.\n",
            "How will you know when youve completed a goal? If your goal is to move to a new house, youll know based on when you sign on the dotted line of your new lease or title papers. Other goals arent measurable at first glance. If your goal is to become a better singer, then how will you know when youve reached it? Set measurable goals instead.[9]For example, you could memorize and perfect a single song. Learn to play an instrument while singing. Hit a new note. Measurable goals give you a sense of completion when youve finished them as you work towards a larger goal.\n",
            "Keep your goals grounded in what you can achieve.\n",
            "Remember that you can only control your own actions, not anyone elses. Become a rock star is not really a feasible goal because it relies on others actions and responses that you cant control. However, form a band and practice our music until were excellent musicians is a goal that your own work can achieve.[10]Focusing on your own actions can help you face setbacks, too, because you will recognize that you cant control the roadblocks you may encounter.Remember that goals can also be processes. For example, become a senator relies too much on others actions, which you cant control. If you dont become a senator, youre likely to consider your goal as a failure even if you did your best. Run for public office is a goal that you can consider achieved, even if you dont win the election, because you went through the whole process to the best of your ability.\n",
            "Create a realistic schedule.\n",
            "Your deadline doesn't have to be exact, but it should be your best guess. Your deadlines must be realistic based on your goals. If you're a part-time worker making minimum wage, don't make your goal to have earned a million dollars by the end of the year. Give yourself enough time to accomplish what you've set out to do.[11]Set a deadline. We all procrastinate. It almost seems like a natural human quality, but when a deadline is approaching, youll work harder to obtain your goal. Think about being in school. When a test was coming up, you knew you needed to study, and you did. Setting goals for yourself should work the same way too.[12]Remember that some goals will take more time to achieve than others. Eat more fruits and vegetables can be achieved very quickly. Become more physically fit will take much more time and effort. Set your timelines accordingly.[13]Take external deadlines and timelines into consideration. For example, if your goal is Find for a new job, make sure to include any application deadlines that your prospective employers have.Set up a rewards system. Humans respond well to reward systems. Whenever you accomplish part of your goal, however small your progress, give yourself a little reward. For example, if your goal is to practice your music more regularly, allow yourself a half-hour with a comic book or your favorite TV program once your daily practice is finished.Stay away from punishing yourself if you dont meet your goals. Punishing yourself or beating yourself up about not accomplishing something can actually hold you back from accomplishment.\n",
            "Identify possible obstacles.\n",
            "Nobody really wants to think about what could go wrong when theyre planning for success. However, identifying potential obstacles and how youll deal with them is crucial to achieving your goals. If you dont, you wont have a game-plan when challenges inevitably present themselves.[14]Obstacles can be external. For example, if your goal is to open your own auto shop, you might not have the money to buy your own shop at first. If your goal is to open your bakery, you might not also have the time to spend with your family that you want.Identify actions you can take to overcome these potential obstacles. For example, you could apply for a business loan, write a business plan to attract investors, or partner with a friend to go into business together.Obstacles can also be internal. For example, a lack of information can be an obstacle, especially in more complex goals. Emotions such as fear and uncertainty can also be internal obstacles.Actions you could take to address a lack of information could include reading up on the subject, asking a mentor for advice, practicing, or taking classes.Acknowledge your limitations. For example, if the obstacle is that you dont have enough time to focus on setting up your business and spending the quality time with your family that you desire, there may not be a way to resolve that tension. However, you can talk with your family to let them know that the situation is only temporary.\n",
            "Tell people about your goals.\n",
            "Some people shy away from letting others in on their life goals. They fear that if they fail, theyll be ashamed. Dont think of it this way. Think of it as allowing yourself to be vulnerable, without which you cant connect with others or grow personally.[15] Others can help you reach your goals, can offer physical assistance, or just give you the necessary moral support.Others may not react as enthusiastically to your goals as you hope. What is important to you may not be as important to others. Recognize that there is a difference between constructive feedback and mean-spirited commentary. Listen to what they have to say, but in the long run, youll have to decide how important your goal is to you.[16]You may also encounter others who do not support your goals. Remember that youre working on your goals for you, not for anyone else. If you constantly meet with negativity from someone about your goals, express that you do not enjoy feeling judged or unsupported. Ask the person to refrain from judging you.\n",

            "[17] One of the hardest steps to achieving your goals is taking that first step. Begin immediately. Even if you dont know what your exact course of action is going to be yet, just go with your gut. Do something that is geared towards your goals. When you complete that step, recognize that you are on your way.[18] Youre more likely to continue working on your goal if you can feel a sense of immediate progress.[19]For example, if your goal is Eat healthier, go grocery shopping to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Clear out your pantry of junk food. Go online and look for healthy recipes. These are small actions that are easily accomplished, but they can add up fast.If you want to learn any new skill, you have to start practising. Strum a guitar and practice basic chords if you want to become an excellent musician. Start reading self-help books designed to help beginners develop new skills. No matter what your goal is, there is a way that you can start immediately.\n",
            "Follow your plan of action.\n",
            "If you followed the steps presented earlier, you should have a good idea of what steps you need to take to achieve your goal. Now is the time to put them into action.[20]For example, if your goal is to buy that three-bedroom house, go to real estate websites and look around for houses that meet (or are close to) the criteria of what you want. Determine your budget and how much of a down payment youll need. Set up a savings account for a down payment and start saving. Build your credit by paying bills responsibly and managing credit lines.\n",
            "Visualize achieving your goal.\n",
            "Research has shown that visualization can help improve your performance.[21] There are two forms of visualization: outcome visualization and process visualization. To meet your goals, combine the two.[22]For outcome visualization, imagine yourself accomplishing your goals. Make this visualization as concrete and detailed as possible. How good does it feel? Who is there to congratulate you? Do you feel proud? Happy?For process visualization, imagine the steps that you must take to achieve your goal. For example, if your goal is to become a small business owner, imagine each action you take to achieve that goal. Imagine yourself creating a business plan, applying for a small business loan, pitching to investors, etc.Process visualization helps your brain encode prospective memories. Psychologists say that this process can help you feel like you can accomplish your goals because your brain already feels some of the success from them.[23]\n",
            "Keep a list.\n",
            "Review your goals daily. Read over your goals at least once a day. Read your goals when you get up in the morning and before you go to bed at night. Reflect on what you have done each day to work towards them.When youve completed a goal on your list, dont scratch it out entirely. Instead, move it to another list, this one for accomplished goals. Sometimes, we focus on what we havent achieved and forget about all the goals weve met. Keep the list of accomplishments around as well. It will be a good source of motivation.\n",
            "Ask for guidance.\n",
            "Find a mentor or someone who has achieved your goal to give you advice. Theyll have insight into ways that you can achieve your goal or things to avoid if you want to succeed. Listen to them carefully. Consult them regularly.Just like in school, you wouldnt necessarily choose to teach yourself advanced mathematics. It is far easier if you have a teacher  someone who knows the formulas to success  to help you along the way, to explain ways of overcoming obstacles, and to celebrate with once youve succeeded. A good mentor will be just as proud of you for achieving your goal as youll be of yourself.\n",
            "Recognize false hope syndrome.\n",
            "False hope syndrome is probably already familiar to you if youve ever set a New Years resolution. Psychologists describe this syndrome in three parts that make up a cycle: 1) setting the goal, 2) feeling surprised by its difficulty, 3) giving up on the goal.[24]False hope syndrome often happens when you expect immediate results from your actions. For example, you might set a goal of Become more physically fit and then get discouraged when youve been working out for two weeks without noticeable changes. Just remember that some goals do take time and setting up clear stages and timeframes can help combat unrealistic expectations.This syndrome can also happen when the initial rush of the goal wears off. For example, the goal Learn to play the guitar is really exciting for a little while, as you buy a new instrument, learn a few chords, etc. However, when the real work of daily practice, calluses, and chord progressions sets in, you may lose momentum. Setting small goals and celebrating small successes can help you keep your momentum going.[25]\n",
            "View challenges as learning experiences.\n",
            "Several studies have shown that people who treat setbacks as learning experiences are more likely to feel positive about their ability to achieve their goals.[26] If you view challenges, setbacks, or even your own mistakes as failures and beat yourself up for them, youll be focusing on the past instead of looking toward the future.Research has shown that people who accomplish their goals dont usually have fewer setbacks than people who give up on their goals. The difference is in how you envision the setbacks. Can you learn from what went wrong to do something differently next time?[27]The drive for perfectionism can also hold you back from acknowledging mistakes as sources of growth. When you hold yourself to impossible standards of performance, youre actually more likely to feel like your goals cant be achieved.[28]Instead, be compassionate with yourself.[29] Remind yourself that you are human, and that all humans make mistakes and experience challenges.Studies have shown that positive thinking is effective at helping people learn and adapt than focusing on your mistakes or flaws. Next time you find yourself beating yourself up over a perceived failure, remind yourself that you can learn from every experience, no matter how unpleasant it is in the moment.[30]\n",
            "Acknowledge every victory.\n",
            "So much of achieving goals is a matter of perception. Celebrate small wins. If your goal is to make straight As and you do well on an exam, celebrate it. If you goal is to become a lawyer, celebrate every hoop you successfully jump through, such as getting into law school, doing well in a course, passing the bar, and finally getting a job.[31]Celebrate benchmarks or milestones. Some goals will take years if not longer to accomplish. Recognize and celebrate the amount of time that youve spent doing something. Practice takes time and effort. Recognize and be proud of the amount of time youve put into something.Celebrate the smallest accomplishments, too. For example, if your goal is Eat healthier and youre able to say no thanks to that greasy but delicious slice of pizza, pat yourself on the back for your willpower.\n",
            "Stay passionate.\n",
            "Whatever your goal is, it is a goal for a reason. It is something that you want for yourself in the future. Let that passion and drive show. Reminding yourself about what you are working towards can help you get through momentary difficulty or unpleasantness. Sometimes, the best destinations force you to take the roughest trails.\n",
            "Revise your goals if necessary.\n",
            "Life is filled with lemons that dont make very good lemonade. Sometimes, unexpected things happen that will affect your plans. Dont be afraid to recalibrate, think of new plans, set new goals, and in some cases reject old goals that you might not care about any more.Setbacks are natural. They shouldnt automatically deter you from your ultimate goals. Recognize why you are facing a setback. Is it something you can control or not? Move forward accordingly.[32]Consider new opportunities. Some of the best things in life arent planned. Say yes to new opportunities if they help further your own goals or present new, better goals.\n",
            "Persevere.\n",
            "Keep track of the small successes you accomplish. Achieving these smaller tasks will help you build your self-confidence, because youll know that youre capable of achieving things you set out to do. Remind yourself of your past successes when you find yourself struggling.[33]Remember that setbacks dont mean failure. Author J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter novels were rejected twelve times in a row before a publisher agreed to take a chance on them. Inventor Thomas Edisons schoolteachers told him he was too stupid to learn anything.[34] Oprah was fired from her first television job and told she was unfit for TV.[35]Sometimes it's that negative feedback from others that fuels our drive to be successful at our goals and dreams.\n",

            "Be motivated to play the sport and play it well.\n",
            "Motivation can drive you a long way and keep you focused. If you really want this to happen, you have to focus on one main thing and that is football.\n",
            "Ensure that you are fit and in shape.\n",
            "Being in good shape and fit are essential for a football player. To achieve your goal, start building your stamina, fitness and agility. A football player must be able to clear a distance of about 6 kms in one hour. You must be physically strong.[1]\n",
            "Enhance your technical ability.\n",
            "Football is not all about stamina and fitness, it is more about your technical and tactical ability. You must have a lot of footballing skills, such as great dribbling, passing, corner kicks and free kicks. It also helps to have your own unique move, one that will cause coaches to look and take notice. Practice as much as you can and play as much as you can.It also helps to watch as many matches as you can, to get an idea of good playing techniques.\n",
            "Join a local club.\n",
            "In order to progress, join a local football club in your area. This means joining a very basic level of club. Here you will feel safe to improvise, review and view your skills. It will also allow you to enhance your footballing skills and give you a good idea as to  how well you can perform.[2]\n",
            "Prepare a video.\n",
            "Prepare a killer video with the help of an HD camera. Show all of your skills in the video, such as free kicks, dribbling and passing.\n",
            "Create a great CV.\n",
            "Just as you need a CV when applying for a job, a football CV should be able to explain to a coach, club, or agent, all about who you are as a player, in less than a minute. Include a player photo, height/weight, positions, experience, links to articles youve been featured in and statistics.[3]The football network Fieldoo allows you to create and share a player CV online. You can even go the extra mile by creating your own.\n",
            "Find opportunities.\n",
            "Now that you have the skills and the tools, you have to find ways to show off your talent. Here are a few ways to find opportunities:Email and call as many clubs as you possibly can, but dont expect replies (you may need to email 50 clubs before receiving a reply!).Check out the Market on Fieldoo.com for opportunities abroad.Consider getting an agent, however many agents can be very deceiving, so be careful.Some players have famously been accepted into pro teams, just by showing up to a practice session with their boots and asking if they could train with them.\n",
            "Perform well.\n",
            "Its easy to only think of getting to the next level, instead of focusing on your performances in matches. Take your football career game-by-game. Every game you play, focus on playing well and giving 110%, as you never know who could be watching. Make sure you build a good relationship with the club, players and club staff, as having their off-field support will contribute to good on-field performances.[4]\n",
            "Be persistent and patient.\n",
            "It is going to be difficult trying to become a pro. Becoming a professional soccer player doesnt happen overnight. It doesnt take months either. It takes years and a lifetime of dedication. When you hear people say that success takes blood, sweat, tears, theyre totally right. In football, no one ever cheated their way to becoming one of the less than 0.001% of the 240 million players worldwide, that made it. It takes time and patience. Sometimes you have to wait for the right opportunity. Sometimes it takes just a bit of luck to swing your direction, but being persistent and having the ability to never give up will determine whether youre successful or not.\n",
            "Sign a professional contract.\n",
            "Ensure that you are confident about your agent. Never hesitate to take things slowly at the start. There will come a time to leap frog and take victory with both hands. Just be careful while signing the contract and have the clauses read over by a lawyer or someone capable of understanding the fine clauses.\n",

            "Purchase and set up all necessary equipment.\n",
            "Just because you dont have any fish doesn't mean you can skimp on the basics,[1] including:A simple filter of your choosing (hang-on back filters are the easiest to find and are suitable for most tanks),A tank light for growing plants, secured properly for safety. Different plants need different light levels, so do research and plan your tank accordingly.An air pump (with airstones and airline tubing). It does not need to be strong, but needs to disturb the water and add oxygen to prevent stagnant water buildup.If your tanks water temperature reaches cool extremes, its best to invest in a heater as well.Sunlight is not a suitable replacement for tank lights! It can heat up the tank; it's unregulated, and accelerates algae growth, so keep your tank away from it.\n",
            "Add gravel, sand, or other plant-friendly substrates and decorations as needed.\n",
            "Wash such material with normal tap water, thoroughly.You can skip decorations, but substrate is vital in planted tanks. Keep in mind that certain plants do better with certain substrates.\n",
            "Add conditioned water.\n",
            "Use a proper water conditioner to prepare; don't just aerate the water. You might also add aquarium salt (1 tbsp per 5 US gallons) to ward off unsightly parasites, but aquatic plants usually dont have many parasitic animals plaguing them. But if you add invertebrates, then do add sea salt for them.Dont, as yet, add the plant fertilizer (substrate or water soluble).\n",
            "Cycle\n",
            "your tank. You must not skip this even if you only want plants. Plants die over time, and a proper bacterial filtration system will make sure ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates dont skyrocket.While some (not a lot!) of nitrates are vital to the plants growth -- ammonia and nitrites are toxic to them. Plants handle the chemicals better than fish do, but its better to err on the caution side.[2]\n",
            "Research your desired plants requirements.\n",
            "Of course, buy freshwater plants. As mentioned before, light requirements are a big factor. If your light is not strong enough (or too strong),[3] then revise your plans. Think about nutritional requirements and how each plant grows. Larger plants shade over others if not arranged properly, blocking out light. All of the plants need to coexist peacefully.Buy from reputable sites. A snail-free promise should be searched for, as snails can reproduce quickly to decimate your tank.Research carefully. Some aquatic plants actually should not be fully submerged. Its great to use these, but dont put them fully in the water.[4] They will rot.Many plants are fine with gravel, but some do poorly in sand. Keep this in mind.\n",
            "Plan the plants positions aesthetically.\n",
            "This is the artsy part of aquascaping. Tall, bushy plants should be near the back to provide a background. Shorter, weedier plants can be in the middle. Smaller, stunningly beautiful plants can be in the front as a centerpiece. Put the airstone in between plants to hide it, if you want. Try to use your imagination to build underwater scenes that have a natural feel to them.If you included natural wood dcor, there are mosses or other plants that flourish on floating wood. Add them to the wood!A good example would be an underwater meadow. Hairgrass, wood, and rocks are used to create the illusion of a scene usually seen on ground.\n",
            "Add nutritional supplements if needed.\n",
            "There are different forms of nutrients, from pellets to solutions. Add the right amount according to your tank and follow instructions to the T. Since there are no fish (even if you will add invertebrates), there will be minimal waste for the plants to utilize. This is key to a healthy tank.Follow suppliers' instructions. Dont just put in whatever seems reasonable. Too much can burn the roots and plants or mess up water chemistry.\n",
            "Add the plants.\n",
            "Rinse off debris with normal tap water and snip off any yellow or dead parts. Hopefully, youve devised a plan on how to arrange them by size and kinds, so work logically. Some plants have a rhizome similar to roots -- but some of those should not be buried, so be careful to read each of their requirements.Plants that grow on wood can be tucked into crevices or held in place gently by a temporary, weak rubber band.Rooted plants should have their roots tucked completely into the substrate.Floating plants can be anchored to aquarium weights or rocks, or left to freely wander.\n",
            "Check and modify the water every two weeks or so.\n",
            "Even if less waste is being produced than in a fish tank, the nitrates will eventually build up. Depending on whether you put special invertebrates in (see Adding Invertebrates) depending on your tank size, and your number of plants, this frequency will change. This is a general rule. Replace 25% of the water, correctly treated and with aquarium/sea salt for health of freshwater fish if you want.Once in a while, use your gravel or substrate vacuum to clean the substrate surface of rotting organic matter.\n",
            "Top off your tank as needed.\n",
            "If you use salt as an electrolyte or supplement for aquatic health, do not add salt to the water when you are only topping it off! When water evaporates from your tank, the salt does not evaporate with it. Adding more salt can make the tank too salty. As always, condition the water.\n",
            "Add fertilizers if needed.\n",
            "Some substrate fertilizers last for a very long time and do not need to be bothered for months. Some liquid varieties require weekly additions, so make sure you keep up on that. A carbon dioxide supplement (recalling that plants make and give off oxygen but need carbon dioxide given off by fish and other animals) can be useful as well, added weekly, and does not harm any animal or plant if used with the correct proportions.[5]\n",
            "Scrubbing off algae may need to be done once in a while to keep up the appearance.\n",
            "Algae is not harmful unless it starts to block out light and suck up too many nutrients. A soft-padded brush (available at pet stores) easily gets the job done. Algae on plants is usually fine. If it bothers you, lightly rub it off with your fingers.Avoid too much algae by keeping the tank away from sun, not using too-strong lights, and not overdoing fertilizer/supplements.\n",
            "Like with getting any new pet, research on what is acceptable for your current tank.\n",
            "These should be added to an established planted tank. Common invertebrates such as mystery snails and shrimp actually function as tank cleaners, eating waste, dead matter. Many species are peaceful, but some can be incredibly aggressive. Some prefer open space, while others prefer hiding spaces. Be mindful.Most pet store variety invertebrates only eat dead matter, but some do eat live plants. Furnishing their needs and protecting your aquatic plants can include putting in bits of plant material.\n",
            "Pick healthy specimens.\n",
            "Bright colors (if applicable), active movements, and an intact body indicate good health.[6] Ask the pet supplier about the conditioning of their invertebrates tanks to get a sense of how they are handled by them. If you see a tank with dead or diseased organisms (even fish), it may be best to pass on the invertebrates in there.Dont be afraid to request particular sizes and kinds of specimens! This is common and acceptable.Avoid buying baby invertebrates for an unestablished tank. They generally do not do well in a newly prepared tank.\n",
            "Add them in slowly and acclimate them.\n",
            "You should not add more than a few of any animal in at one time, to let the tank get used to it. Adding them in means that you should put them in a bucket of your tank water and gently scoop them out of the bag of store water. Dumping the bags contents into your tank can stress them and introduce questionable pet-store water into your water.The best method to acclimate them is to simply float the animals bag in the tank water for at least 30 minutes.\n",
            "Feed them properly.\n",
            "Giving them debris from cleaning a fish tank does not provide enough food for invertebrates. Giving them a balanced diet of bits of vegetables, pellets, or frozen foods ensures healthiness. You want to make your invertebrates part of the whole underwater scene, not just a side attraction. Feed them well and they will grow beautifully!Inadequate feeding of vegetable food will push normal scavengers into eating your plants at times, so protect your plants by feeding adequately.Remove food after a few hours/within the day if not eaten, to prevent mold/algae.\n",
            "Enjoy the sight of your creatures among your nice plants!\n",
            "Shrimp can enhance visual appeal of the tank, while tidying it. This type of tank can sustain/clean itself nicely, with animals and plants working together. Still, take care of your tank!\n",

Choose an image that is representative of that loved one according to the relationship you had with him or her. The more significant the image is to you, the easier it will be to establish a connection.Ask your deceased loved one a question after you have held that person's image in your mind for several seconds. Keep your mind focused on that image and wait. Do not answer how you believe that person would answer. Instead, be patient until you receive a reply that you can be certain did not come from your own mind.\n",
            "Ask for a response to simple questions.\n",
            "This technique is not as useful for contacting dead loved ones, but it is a common practice used by paranormal investigators who are attempting to talk with spirits at a location that is haunted or potentially haunted. Go to a room in which the most paranormal activity takes place. Ask basic yes-or-no questions, and request a specific method of answering. The most common two methods of reply are knocking and flashlights.For knocking, instruct any spirits in the room to give one knock for yes or two for no.If using a flashlight, go with a flashlight that can be turned on easily, like one with a button on the end. Turn it on and unscrew the front section until the flashlight just barely goes off. Set it down on a flat surface and position it so that it cannot roll away on its own. Gently push on the power button and make sure that the light can flicker on and off. Instruct any spirits in the room to tap on the button once for yes or twice for no.\n",
            "Work with a medium.\n",
            "Mediums are well versed in connecting with spirits of the dead. You can usually contact a medium by searching for one online or in a phone book. If you want to speak to a dead loved one, the medium may ask to meet at your home or may have you come to his or her place of work.If you want a medium to speak to a spirit you believe to be in your home, the medium will need to come to your home. Not every medium will perform the latter service, but most will provide the former.Be wary about the medium you choose to go to. Even those who are not skeptical about the practice of speaking to the dead will usually be willing to acknowledge that not every medium is legitimate. As with anything else, there are scam artists out there. Research a medium before scheduling an appointment with him or her and try to verify that he or she is the real deal. When you meet for your appointment, take note of whether or not the medium is leading you on with questions and having you provide the answers they claim to be offering.\n",
            "Look into EVP and EMP technologies.\n",
            "[2] An EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomena, occurs when a voice that is not audible to the naked human ear gets recorded on a digital recording. A EMP, or Electromagnetic Pulse, can only be registered using an EMP meter. To attempt either option, you should go to a room that is known to have high spiritual energy and ask questions there.When looking for EVP, you can ask just about any question. This is the practice most commonly used when trying to find out a spirit's name or other unknown details. Ask your questions, providing a lengthy pause in between each so that any spirits there have time to answer. Replay the recording and listen carefully for any murmurs or unusual sounds that could translate into answers.An EMP is usually limited to yes-or-no questions. The most commonly used EMP meter is a light-up device, which lights up when electromagnetic energy gets high. Ask your questions and instruct any spirits in the room that lighting up the meter once equals a yes, while lighting it up twice equals a no.\n",
            "Conduct a sance\n",
            ". A sance is a gathering of people who communicate with the dead using their collective energy.[3] To perform one, you will need at least three people who are open to the experience. This practice can be used to talk to dead loved ones or wandering spirits. Be warned, however, that you do run a notable risk of contacting a malicious spirit.Set the mood by dimming the lights and lighting candles. Use three candles, or a number of candles divisible by three. You may even light incense.Have the participants hold candles around a table to create a circle. Perform a chant to call out to the spirits.Alternatively, you may also attempt to call the spirits using a Ouija board.[4]Wait for a response, repeating your chant as necessary.Once you make a connection, calmly ask your questions.Break the sance by breaking the circle and putting the candles out.\n",
            "Say prayers.\n",
            "Not every faith has a practice you can use for praying to or for the dead, but some do. These prayers are often intercessory in nature and take two forms.In the first, you are praying for the deceased loved one to find rest and joy in the afterlife, rather than to them specifically, but it might be with the knowledge that your dead loved one is listening or aware of your prayers.In the second, you are praying to the deceased loved one. You are not asking for salvation from the spirit, but you are asking your loved one to intercede or pray for you from the other side. Some believe that, as a part of the spiritual realm, the spirit of someone who had strong faith in life will be able to make a more ardent plea or prayer for you to a deity from the other side.\n",
            "Look into mirror gazing.\n",
            "Mirror gazing is a practice some use in an effort to talk to dead loved ones. It is similar to trying to connect to the spirit using your mind, but in this practice, you use a mirror to help establish the connection more clearly.Quiet your thoughts. Go to a silent room where you can be alone and stand in front of a mirror. Close your eyes and rid yourself of anxiety, intense emotion, or unrelated thought.Focus your thoughts on the person you want to speak with. Create an image of that person in your mind. Make the image as clear as possible until you can practically see their features.Open your eyes slowly and look into the mirror. Imagine that the image in your mind will appear in the mirror. Even if the image is blurry or overlaps with your own, you should be able to see the image of your deceased loved one in the mirror.Ask your questions. Do not force answers, but be open to them. Also be aware of the fact that the answers may come as emotions or images rather than words.\n",
            "Communicate with the deceased through a possession.\n",
            "Some have found that objects owned by a deceased person are still connected to that person's spirit. Possessions can give you the power to call that person's spirit to you and make it possible to communicate. If you wish to talk with a loved one who has passed away, seek out an item of clothing, a book, or some other personal object that the person used. Take it to the place where the person lived or stayed. Hold the object and initiate a conversation.\n",
            "Talk without asking for a reply.\n",
            "If you are hesitant or skeptical about talking to dead loved ones using paranormal or supernatural means, you can always talk to the dead without asking for an answer in return.[5] For those who believe in the existence of spirits, it is also a common belief that those spirits may watch over living loved ones. You can talk to a deceased loved one anywhere, or you could choose a location that has special meaning, such as a grave or a place where you shared a memorable experience. Tell the person whatever is on your mind. You can ask questions, but since you are not looking for answers, you do not necessarily need to limit yourself to questions.\n",

            "Connectivity options and service providers vary by area, but you'll usually find options for broadband cable, DSL, as well as satellite and fiber (FIOS).[1]  It's best to contact the providers directly to find out about services available to your address.Companies that offer cable and satellite television services typically offer internet services as well.DSL services are often provided through telephone companies.\n",
            "Set up professional installation if necessary.\n",
            "If your home isn't properly equipped for the type of internet service you're signing up for, the ISP will need to come prepare your home.[2]For example, if you don't have cable coaxial jacks but want broadband internet, you'll need a technician to come out and install a jack and prepare cable service.In many cases, the technician who comes out can also install all of the equipment necessary to get you online.\n",
            "Gather your equipment.\n",
            "Most ISPs (internet providers) provide all of the hardware you'll need to set up your internet connection in your home, including a modem and any necessary cables. If you choose a professional installation from the provider, they'll bring the equipment to your home and set it up for you. If you want to do it yourself, the ISP will either mail you the equipment, or allow you to come pick it up.A modem is the device that connects to the jack in your wall and essentially connects your house to the internet. A router is a secondary device that allows multiple devices to connect to the internet through the router.It's very common to receive a device that's both a modem and a router (often called a \"wireless gateway,\" which makes setup especially easy.Some ISPs offer a modem for free (you'll need to return it if you cancel service) but offer a wireless router at a small rental fee. If you want to avoid renting hardware, you can always purchase your own router, but it'll always be easiest to set up (and get tech support) if you use the equipment from your ISP.\n",
            "Grab your ISP's setup instructions.\n",
            "Setting up internet access is going to be a little different for everyone, as all ISPs, modems, and routers vary. Your provider will give you all of the information you'll need to get started, including any required usernames and passwords for your router, web addresses for setup, and even phone or tablet apps you can install for quick modem and router setup. Follow your ISP's instructions exactly for best results.\n",
            "Connect your modem to the wall jack.\n",
            "If you're using a DSL modem (or modem/router combo), you'll need to connect it to the telephone jack using the telephone cable that came with your modem. If you're using broadband or satellite, connect your modem (or modem/router combo) to the cable jack with a coaxial cable.If you already have a device connected to the jack, you can use a splitter, which will allow you to plug two different devices into a single jack. Many providers include a splitter in their self-installation kits.\n",
            "Plug the modem into a power source and turn it on.\n",
            "The modem needs power to work, so make sure it's securely plugged in.

Several lights may flash during this process.\n",

            "If you have a separate router that isn't combined with your modem into a single wireless gateway, you'll need to plug it into a power source and connect it to your modem using an Ethernet cable. Connect one end of the Ethernet cable into the available port on the back of the modem, and the other end into your router's \"INTERNET\" or \"WAN\" port.[4]\n",
            "Follow your internet provider's instructions to connect.\n",
            "Once your modem and/or router is up and running, the remaining steps will vary depending on your internet provider and equipment. Many major providers now offer easy setup using mobile apps you can install on your Android, iPhone, or iPad.If no mobile app is available, you'll need to connect your computer to the router or modem with an Ethernet cable, and then follow your provider's instructions to configure your router through your web browser.During the setup process, you'll usually be able to create (or at least write down) your Wi-Fi access point name and password.

Each of these different oils offer unique therapeutic benefits that can enhance and improve the effects of a certain type of body massage.To warm up the oil, pour the oil into a metal container and place it in a pot of water on the stove. Turn the stove to low heat and let the oil warm up.[2]Alternatively, you can put the oil bottle in a bowl filled with warm water.[3]You can also rub the massage oil between your hands right before the massage to warm up the oil.Always check the temperature of the oil to ensure it is not too hot before you use it for the massage.

            "Purchase TVP.\n",
            "TVP looks like dried cereal and may be purchased in plastic bags or resealable containers. It has a long shelf life and can be found in your grocery store's health food section or with other bulk foods.Textured vegetable protein in a non-sealed sack has a shelf life of about a year, but textured vegetable protein in an airtight container will last much longer.Because textured vegetable protein is made from soybeans, the cost of the product is relatively inexpensive.You can purchase flavored TVP, either dry or frozen, which can be heated and added to a number of dishes. However, since TVP is so easy to cook with and flavor yourself, it's best to start with dried TVP free of additives and flavors. That way, you can add whatever spices and flavors you want, without the extra chemicals.\n",
            "Measure out your TVP in a bowl.\n",
            "Ground beef cooks down and shrinks when you apply heat, but since TVP gains volume when you reconstitute it, it will stretch a lot further. To make a meal that will feed 2 - 4 people, you'll need about 2 cups of dry TVP.\n",

            "The ratio of water to TVP should be 1:1. To reconstitute the TVP, you simply add hot water and let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes. The TVP will begin to fluff and take on the texture of ground beef.If you'd prefer, you can simply add the TVP to a pot of soup or a sauce that contains plenty of liquid. The TVP will reconstitute as part of the dish - there's no need to do it separately.If you're working with larger pieces of TVP, such as TVP cutlets, you might want to squeeze the reconstituted pieces so they aren't full of excess water.\n",
            "Add spices and seasonings.\n",
            "Now that you have a bowl of reconstituted TVP, use it as a canvas to add your favorite spices, just the way you would any other protein. You can season it with a simple mixture of salt and pepper, give it Italian flair with some oregano and sage, or make it spicy with cayenne.\n",
            "Use the TVP as part of a meal.\n",
            "You can make TVP tacos or enchiladas, TVP chili, TVP burgers - the sky's the limit.

            "Do wall shin raises.\n",
            "These are simple exercises to stretch your shins while resting your back against a wall. As long as you have a solid background for support, you can do them just about anywhere.[1]Stand with your shoulders, back, and butt up against a wall. Place your feet away from the wall, with your heels about one foot-length in front of you.Keeping your heels on the ground, raise your toes upward. Stretch as far as possible. This is called dorsiflexion.Slowly lower your toes back toward the ground, but dont let them touch the floor.Repeat the exercise with 1015 reps. Once you have finished the reps, let your feet back on the floor for a quick rest, then do one or two more sets.\n",
            "Do single leg raises.\n",
            "This exercise is very similar to the wall shin raise, but using only one foot at a time. It is a big more difficult because you will only be supporting yourself on one leg. This is a good exercise to build to after regular wall shin raises.Stand with your back against the wall, and rest one foot lightly against the wall.Dorsiflex with the foot on the ground for 1015 reps. Once you are finished, switch your feet and repeat on the other leg.Because you are only using one leg at a time, you dont need to rest between switching your legs.\n",
            "Do heel step-downs.\n",
            "This is a simple exercise that you can do without a wall. Youll be doing the same kind of dorsiflexion as the wall stand, but this time while simulating a walk.[2]Stand up straight, not leaning against anything, with your feet about shoulder-width apart.Take a step forward, making sure only your heel plants. The step should be a normal size, so about how long you would take while walking.Hold your toes in the air, making sure the ball of your foot doesnt get any closer than an inch to the floor.Step back to the starting position.Repeat this step with the same foot for 1015 reps, then switch to the other leg.One variation on this exercise is to try walking around the room on your heels. Just make sure you walk very slowly, and maintain your balance. If you start to feel like you are losing your balance, rest your toes on the ground to settle.[3]\n",
            "Do a seated shin stretch.\n",
            "This is a simple stretching exercise you can do anywhere. Youll probably want to be on a softer surface since you are on the floor.[4]Get on the floor, resting on your knees. Stretch out your feet so that your toes are pointed behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor.Gently lean backward, pushing down on your heels to stretch out the front of your leg.Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeat three times.If you want to increase the stretch, do one leg at a time to increase the weight. You can also try lifting up your knees to further increase the resistance.\n",
            "Do some heel drops.\n",
            "These are simple exercises that use a ledge, like a step, to provide some resistance to your foot. This is probably best to do on the bottom of a staircase, or on a small platform, rather than using a step on the top of your stairwell.[5]Stand with your toes on the edge of a step. Make sure you have something nearby to balance yourself.Shift your weight on to one leg (say the right), then lift the other foot (the left) off of the step.Lower your right heel downward, making sure your toes point upward.Return to your starting position, then switch legs and repeat with the other foot.\n",
            "Do toe curls.\n",
            "These are simple exercises you can do with a towel on the floor. Just make sure your feet are firmly planted on the floor. You can hold on to something for balance if you need it.[6]Stand at the edge of the towel with your feet hip-width apart.Use the toes on one foot to gather the edge of your towel and pull it toward you.Push the towel back into position.Repeat with your other foot.\n",
            "Do calf stretches.\n",
            "This exercise uses an exercise band to help pull your toes toward you. This action strengthens the shin muscle. You can also use a towel in place of the band if you dont have one.[7]Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you.Loop the exercise band around the bottom of your feet, near the arch.Gently pull the band back into dorsiflexion, that is raising your toes upward toward your shins as far as possible, and hold that position for 1015 seconds.Repeat two to three times on the same foot, then switch to the other leg. You can switch legs between reps, but it will probably be quicker not to keep swapping the band around each foot.The exercise band you use for this and other shin exercises should be a strip design, which will wrap around your foot and ankles. When purchasing your band, consider the resistance based on your current fitness level. If you are already active, and working on your shins to improve your current workout, youll want to consider bands with heavy resistance, for average untrained men or active women, or extra-heavy resistance, for active men and strong women.[8]\n",
            "Do a shin resistance exercise.\n",
            "This exercise uses the band and a fixed object to help extend your lower leg. Your foot will use the band as resistance to pull against when flexing. All you need is the exercise band and something solid you can wrap it around.[9]Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you. Make sure your toes are pointed up toward the ceiling.[10]Loop the exercise band around the top of your foot and a stationary object. This can be a table leg, or anything else that will stay securely in place.Dorsiflex your foot against the resistance, pulling your toes back against the band.Repeat for 1015 reps, then switch legs. For increase the resistance, you can build to using a heavier band, or doubling your reps to 2030 per leg.\n",
            "Do a monster walk.\n",
            "If you have a little bit more space to do some walking, you can use the resistance band to stretch by taking steps. This will help stretch your shins and hip abductor muscles.[11][12]Stand up, placing your feet shoulder-width apart.Wrap the resistance band around your ankles or thighs.Step forward and to the right with your right leg. Then bring your left leg forward so that it is even with the right.Take a step backward toward your original position, then bring your other leg back to even.If you have the space, you can take several steps forward before going backward.

            "Envy and jealousy are not the same thing, but they are often confused. It is important to know the difference between envy and jealousy to determine which emotion you are feeling. Jealousy is a reaction to the threat of losing something you already possess. Envy is a reaction to a something you think you lack.[1]For example, jealousy is what you feel when you see your girlfriend flirting with another guy. Envy is what you feel when you see a friend driving up in a brand new sports car.\n",
            "Think about how envy harms you.\n",
            "How has envy impacted your life in a negative way? Maybe a long-term friendship is on the verge of dissolving because you can't pretend to be happy for your friend anymore, so you avoid her calls. Maybe you check your ex's Facebook page obsessively to glare at pictures of him and his fiance. Maybe you hate-read a classmate's photography blog, wishing you had anything close to his artistic ability. These are all examples of the way envy saps energy that could be better spent on something more positive. Envy might be harming you in the following ways:[2]Taking up your timeConsuming your thoughtsRuining your personal and professional relationshipsWarping your personalityCreating negativity\n",
            "Identify the reason why you are envious.\n",
            "Before you can deal with your envy in a constructive way, you need to figure out what is causing it. If you feel envy over your friends new sports car, take some time to examine the reason why you feel envious. Ask yourself questions to identify the cause of your envy before dealing with your envy.[3][4]For example, are you envious because you want a car like the one he has? Or are you envious of his ability to afford something so expensive?Try to figure out which fear your envy is tapping into. For example, the fear could be connected to your own lack of self-esteem or your inability to trust yourself.[5]\n",
            "Write about your feelings.\n",
            "Journaling is a great way to express your feelings and deal with negative emotions. Journaling about your envy may help you to start to understand it better and begin to deal it. Start by writing down the reason that you feel envious. Describe the source of your envy in as much detail as you can. Try to determine why you are envious of this person.For example, you might write about your friend driving up in his new sports car and how that made you feel. What was your mood like at the time? How did you feel when he pulled up? What did you feel like doing/saying? What did you actually do/say? How did you feel after he left? How do you feel thinking back on it? What would you like to feel?\n",
            "Consider talking to a friend about your envious feelings.\n",
            "Telling a supportive friend or family member how you are feeling may help you feel better and help you to express your emotions. Choose someone who is not closely involved with the person you envy. Also, make sure to choose someone who will be supportive and who will listen to you. Choosing someone who will brush off your feelings or who will not offer good support may make you feel worse.\n",
            "Consider seeking help from a therapist if you cant move past your envy on your own.\n",
            "For some people, envy can interfere with daily life and happiness. Without help, it may be hard to understand your envy and determine the best way to deal with those feelings. A licensed mental health professional can help you to understand these feelings and help you work through them.\n",
            "Stop judging yourself so harshly.\n",
            "When you're envious of someone else, it often stems from feelings of personal inadequacy. You're focused on how someone else has the career, partner, possessions, or intelligence you want, and these desires are rooted in what you perceive to be your own shortcomings. Try to back down from judging yourself so harshly and you won't be as inclined to compare your situation unfavorably to someone else's.[6]For example, maybe you're envious of your friend's amazing career, which has taken off while yours is still in its fledgling stage. Try to be more patient with yourself - you'll get your turn in the spotlight if you just keep working hard.Envy stems from being judgmental in general - thinking that this is better than that, and making your decisions based on getting what you don't have. Try to  be more open minded instead of deciding that some qualities are good to have and some aren't.\n",
            "Forgive the person you envy and yourself.\n",
            "Forgiveness is an important part of moving past envy because resenting someone for their success will only weigh you down.[7] One exercise that may help you to deal with envy is to declare your forgiveness for the person that you envy (not in their presence, of course) and for yourself as well. Simply take a moment when you are alone to verbalize your forgiveness.Remember that you are not forgiving the other person for wrongdoing. You are choosing to view their situation from their perspective. By considering their perspective, you can empathize with their pride and accomplishments in a compassionate way.For example, you might say something like, I am proud with Sharon for having so much success in her career. I also forgive myself for being behind her on my path to success.\n",
            "Turn your envy into appreciation.\n",
            "To overcome envy, it is important to appreciate what you already have as well as what the person you envy has earned. One way that you can start to change your perspective and overcome your envy is to find a way to appreciate the success or fortune of others. Work on developing a sense of happiness for the person who achieved or obtained what you envy them for. For example, try to be happy for a friend who can afford a sports car and change your envy into admiration.It might help you to state your admiration out loud. For example, you might say to your friend, Congratulations on the new car! I am really happy for you and all of your success.\n",
            "Use your envy to generate a goal.\n",
            "Once you have identified the cause of your envy, you can deal with it in a constructive way by turning it into something positive, such as a goal. Using your envy to form a realistic, achievable goal will help you to stop dwelling on your negative feelings and feel empowered to change something in your life for the better.[8]For example, if you are envious of a friends new sports car because you wish you had the financial freedom to afford something like that, make it your goal to earn and/or save more money.Break larger goals into smaller, measurable goals. For example, if your goal is to earn and/or save more money. One of your smaller goals might be to look for a higher paying job or find out about opportunities for advancement at your current job. Another small goal might be to save $20 per week.\n",
            "Live by your own definition of success.\n",
            "Are you evaluating yourself and other people based on superficial ideas of what it means to be successful? Success does not necessarily mean having a big house, two cars and a high-powered job, or being so beautiful that people can't stop staring. Success is about finding out what life is best for you and living it to the very fullest. If you worry less about society's standards for success, and focus instead on what gets you going every day, you'll be less likely to fall into comparing yourself to other people so much.[9]Remember that it's ok to be at a different stage in your life than other people. For instance, just because you might not have the job or partner you want yet, doesn't mean you're any less of a person than the person you're envious of. Life is not a serious of boxes we all check off on our way to happiness. Everyone travels a different path, and no one's is more meaningful or better than anyone else's.\n",
            "Realize you don't know the whole story.\n",
            "It might look like someone else has it all - the perfect boyfriend, great hair, straight As, you name it. However, there is always more to the story, because it's impossible for anyone to have a perfect life. If someone seems to have everything you want, chances are you have something they want, too. Don't put people up on a pedestal and grind your teeth thinking they must have been born under a lucky star. You may not ever know what their weakness is - after all, most people are adept at hiding their imperfections - but you can be sure it's there.Reflecting on the fact that everyone has a struggle, need, or want may be enough to remind you that everyone is in the same boat. It's not necessary to go digging to find out what soft spots the person has! Rest assure there is something you aren't seeing. Try to put aside your thoughts of envy and focus on yourself.\n",
            "Remember that others' success doesn't have to impact yours.\n",
            "Let's say that someone you know started a running regimen, lost 20 pounds and just completed her first marathon. Sure, the person made a great achievement, but there's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing! Your success in life does not hinge on someone else's. Whether it comes to finding love, getting a good job or anything else you want, you can have it, regardless of how successful someone else might be.Focusing on improvement can help in situations when another's success does impact yours (for example, two or more people competing for the same job with only opening or trying to get the same person as their exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend).  You develop useful skills and contacts and are focusing on realizing your potential.  If you achieve the goal, that's good all around.  If not, you have still improved yourself and gained new skills or insight.\n",
            "Focus on your talents and assets.\n",
            "Now that you've stopped comparing yourself to other people, let's focus on what you have going for you. Channel your energy into your good qualities, so you become better and better at what you do and who you are. When you're focused on perfecting that cello song or writing an amazing thesis, there's not time to worry about what other people are doing.[10]When you find your mind drifting to the realm of what you don't have, make a conscious effort to think about what you do have. Do this every single time you feel those pangs of envy. If you refuse to let your mind dwell, and focus instead on what makes you special and great, you'll start having a much more positive outlook.Realize that not everyone has what you have - in fact, your talents and assets might even be the source of others' envy.\n",
            "Be thankful for your loved ones.\n",
            "Imagine the people who care about you and would do anything for you, and think about what you'd do for them. Focusing on the people who make your life feel full is a positive way to cancel out feelings of envy. Instead of thinking that your life is lacking something, be thankful for the people who are there. Being grateful is a lot like being  mindful. It's about focusing on the present and turning your thoughts to what is already good in your life, instead of thinking about what's lacking.\n",
            "Change what you can change, accept what you can't.\n",
            "It's important to know what you can change and what is beyond your control. Spend energy working to improve the former and don't waste your time on the latter, because there's nothing you can do about it. If you dwell on things you can't change, you'll end up feeling extremely negative, and maybe even becoming depressed. You have a finite amount of time to spend, and you don't want to waste it on something that's not going to budge.For example, if you wish you had your friend's musical talent, and you want nothing more than to be a singer-songwriter, try your best to become what you want to be. Pour your soul into making music, take voice lessons, perform at open mic nights - give it all you've got. If you think you have a shot at making it in the music scene, or you just feel so passionate about music that you want to spend your life singing, don't let anything stop you.On the other hand, there are some things in life that aren't affected by hard work and strong desire. If you're in love with your friend's wife, and they're happily married, you're going to have to accept that this is something you can't change. It's important to come to a place of acceptance before your envy turns into an extremely negative force.\n",
            "Spend time with grateful people.\n",
            "If your friends are the type to constantly compare jobs, partners and kids, complain about what they don't have and cut down people who do, you might want to start spending time with different people. If you spend enough time with people who aren't grateful for what they have, you're going to end up feeling that way, too. Be around people who are content - not rub-it-in-your-face content, but happy enough that they don't slam other people or constantly complain. Find friends who are nonjudgmental, generous, and kind, and you'll start feeling that way about yourself and others, too.\n",
            "Start a gratitude journal.\n",
            "If it has been awhile since you thought about the good things in your life, take out a pen and a piece of paper and start writing them down. A gratitude journal can be a great way of helping you change your perspective and appreciate what you have. If a journal isnt your style, consider starting a video blog (aka vlog) or drawing in a sketchbook. Since envy is about your perception of what you lack, put some time and energy into reminding yourself of what you have. Here are a few ideas to include in your journal:Your talentsYour favorite physical featuresYour best friendYour dogYour favorite foodsThings that make you laughMemories that make you smileFuture occasions to which you're looking forwardFavorite items you ownAccomplishments\n",
            "Focus only on positive things for a day.\n",
            "If you're an envious person who keeps it completely to yourself, you might not need to try this trick. However, if envy has consumed your personality and made you more negative than you'd like to be, try going a full day without making one complaint. It's not something you could do forever - after all, it's OK to feel annoyed about things now and then! - but foregoing complaining for a day might show you just how often you open your mouth to say something negative. If you find yourself keeping quiet for most of the day, the experience could be quite telling.If you give this a try, consider all complaining off limits - even complaints about yourself. No cutting yourself down, comparing yourself unfavorably to someone else, or wishing things were different.You might realize that your complaining impacts those around you as well. It's really not fun to be around someone who is constantly seeing the glass as half empty. Changing your attitude could result in improved relationships.\n",
            "Stay away from negative input for a week.\n",
            "\"Negative input\" means anything that feeds your envy and makes you wish for something you don't or can't have. The more obsessive it makes you, the worse it is for your psyche, so try going without it for a week to see if you feel better. Here are a few examples of negative input:Advertisements. If you're constantly seeing ads for clothes you can't afford, for example, you might feel envious of those who have nice clothes. The ads are making your envy worse. You might have to stop watching TV and read a novel instead of fashion magazines for a week.Social media. If you feel stung by the \"humble\" braggarts when you log into Facebook, you aren't alone. In fact, studies show that envy increases with Facebook use.[11] If you tend to lurk on Facebook and other social media a lot, turn it off for at least a week.\n",
            "Remind yourself that you are in control.\n",
            "If you often feel envious of things that people have, remind yourself that you could have those things too, but you choose not to. For example, if you really wanted a designer wardrobe, you could rack up a massive amount of credit card debt, but maybe you don't do that because you value your credit. If you are making wise choices for yourself (like avoiding credit card debt), you should feel proud of those decisions.\n",
            "Compliment five people per day.\n",
            "Try to make it five new people each day, so you aren't complimenting the same people over and over. Compliment each person on something you genuinely admire about that person - don't take the easy route and compliment on something too shallow. Taking the time to think about what you really like about people, and then expressing that out loud, will help your mind stay in a positive place. You won't be as worried about comparing yourself to others.Research has suggested that complimenting the person you envy can benefit you. Look for ways to compliment the person you envy on their hard work and other attributes that you value.\n",
            "Volunteer.\n",
            "If you can't wrench your mind away from thoughts of what you don't have, spend time helping people who don't have much at all. Sometimes we fall into mental ruts that make it all but impossible to see how good we have it. Give yourself a dose of reality by volunteering in a soup kitchen, hospital, or animal shelter for a day. Reflect on your experience afterward. Helping other people can enable you see how rich you really are, and how much positive energy you have to offer the world.\n",

            "Play on the strong side of the formation.\n",
            "The outside linebacker on the strong side of the formation is often referred to as the Sam.[2] Using the offensive center (the one who hikes the ball) as the middle line, the strong side of an offense is the side where more players lined up with the offenses tight end usually among the strong-side players.\n",
            "Take on the lead blockers.\n",
            "The lead offensive blockers will try to hang up the defense and route the defensive line to make holes for running backs or tight ends. In addition to the rest of the defensive line, the Sam has to help close the gaps created and maintained by lead blockers.[3] One of the keys to taking on lead blockers is in the hit and shed maneuver where a linebacker makes contact with a blocker then disconnects while maintaining the proper position.[4]The correct stance for this requires the feet pointing forward just over shoulder-width apart, weight on the balls of the feet, back straight, head up, and knees flexed.[5]Make contact with the side of the leading foot. To maintain balance, contact the blocker with the shoulder, forearm, or hand on the same side as the leading foot.[6]Keep hips low and push upward on the blocker with the legs rather than simply upper body strength.[7]By keeping the hips and stance low, the linebacker can equally keep his pads low, which helps to get under and uproot the blocker, thus allowing him to disconnect with the blocker and reassess the next movement for the play.[8]The positioning to get under the pads and through the offensive blockers is very important for outside linebackers because the tackles and guards with whom they make contact often have distinct weight advantages.\n",
            "Contain the running back.\n",
            "If a quarterback calls a running play, that means hell hand off the ball to the running back who will then try to find a hole in the defensive line. One of the duties of the Sam is to plug just such a hole in the defensive line to tackle the running back and stop him from getting through on the strong side.\n",
            "Cover the tight end.\n",
            "In addition to covering the running back in a rushing play, the Sam also needs to remain adaptable to covering the tight end who usually plays from the strong side of the offensive formation. Depending on the play, the tight ends job can be to help stop the defensive line from blitzing the quarterback, block the defensive line to help make a hole for a running back, or to get open as an outlet receiver for when a quarterback doesnt have time to complete a pass to a wide receiver. The Sam takes on the tight end in nearly every play, so he must quickly adapt to the role the tight end takes on any given play.In the event that the tight end does manage to get open as an outlet receiver and the quarterback does complete a pass to him, its also the Sams job to tackle the tight end as soon as the pass is completed.\n",
            "Cover cut-back running backs.\n",
            "The weak-side linebacker (commonly referred to as Will) is not by any means a weaker player, simply playing from the less-covered side without having to worry about the tight end. A running back who has been handed the ball may often cut to the weaker side of the formation depending on the play, in which case it is the Wills job to tackle and halt progress of the ball.Wills are often a bit lighter and faster than strong-side outside linebackers and middle linebackers. While the other two are akin to hammers pounding the lead and secondary blockers, the Wills job is to penetrate and make a play on the ball.[9]\n",
            "Prevent passes to running backs or fullbacks.\n",
            "Many plays may call for a running back or fullback to come out of the backfield to act as an outlet receiver in the event that a quarterback senses trouble before being able to complete a longer pass. In these cases, its the Wills job to cover the back to prevent a pass or at least tackle the back immediately after the pass is completed.\n",
            "Blitz the quarterback.\n",
            "Because its the Wills job to exploit holes created by the rest of the defensive line to attack the ball, weak-side outside linebackers make their fair share of quarterback sacks.\n",

Think about exactly what you want your finances to look like and what you can do to achieve those goals.Setting short-term goals in addition to long-term goals can help keep you motivated by providing you with a sense of accomplishment.Create a budget for non-essential items and hold yourself accountable for it each month. If you go over-budget one month, tell yourself that your budget for the next month is reduced as a result.\n",
            "Stop comparing yourself to others.\n",
            "If you're spending beyond your means because you feel that you need to keep up with your friends or show others that you can afford a certain lifestyle, you're not doing yourself any favors. Stop worrying about what others can afford and think about how you can live within your means.Stop equating your self-worth with your ability to buy things. This kind of thinking will make you extremely unhappy in the long run and will probably get you stuck in debt forever.Change your attitude on consumer goods. Stop reading fashion, home style, and consumer technology magazines and watching flashy TV shows that make you feel bad about not having the latest designer item, gadget, or home improvement item.Choose quality products that will last a long time, but don't pay more for brand-name items just because they are fashionable.\n",
            "Track your expenses.\n",
            "To understand exactly where all your money is going, keep careful track of every dollar you spend. You can do this with a pen and paper or electronically if you use a card for everything, but make sure to account for everything. This simple habit will help you spend more wisely.[1]Try categorizing your expenses and adding them up on a monthly basis. For example, you could create categories for food, housing, transportation, utilities, insurance, entertainment, and clothing. Then calculate what percentage of your income you are spending on each category. You might realize that your expenses in some of these categories are way too high.When purchasing a non-essential item, try thinking about how many hours you would have to work to pay for it.Make sure to plan for large expenses too. For example, if you pay $600 for car insurance twice a year, calculate $100/month into your expenses.To understand how much you can afford to spend each day, subtract your fixed expenses from your monthly income and divide the remaining amount by 31.\n",

            "If you are broke because you have credit card debt, a car payment, or student loans, think about what you can do to pay off these debts faster.Making even a few extra payments each year can help you pay off your debts much faster.While making extra payments towards your debt might make your budget even tighter in the immediate future, it will pay off in the long run because you will be debt-free much sooner.Make sure you understand how long it will take you to pay off your credit cards if you only pay the minimum amount due and how much you will end up paying in interest.You may be able to renegotiate the terms of your loans to get better interest rates. It doesn't hurt to ask!\n",
            "Start saving.\n",
            "This may seem impossible if you are always broke, but planning for the future will help you get out of this cycle. Start small by just putting $50 in an emergency fund each month. Don't forget to save for retirement! Take advantage of the 401k offerings at your company or open an IRA account.Saving money is much easier if you set up automatic withdrawals from your paycheck or your checking account so you never have to think about it.Never deplete your savings for whims.\n",

            "While you may want to help out your loved ones who are in need, you really shouldn't be lending money if you can't afford to pay your own bills.\n",
            "Avoid payday loans.\n",
            "While they may seem like a good solution if you're strapped for cash, the interest rates are ridiculously high, so they will only get you further into debt.\n",
            "Understand how much it will really cost.\n",
            "Before you take out any kind of loan or finance any purchase, be sure to calculate what your monthly payments will be, how long it will take you to repay the debt, and how much you will be paying in interest.In some cases, paying interest may be worth it. For example, most people cannot afford to purchase a house without taking out a mortgage, but depending on the price of the house and the average cost of rent in your area, you might still be saving a significant amount of money by choosing to buy with a mortgage instead of renting.Be especially wary of high interest rates for depreciating assets like vehicles. If you decide to sell your vehicle after you have owned it for several years, it may be worth less than what you owe on it. This can also happen with real estate when the market conditions are poor.Always read the fine print for credit cards. Your interest rate may increase after a certain amount of time.\n",

            "If you have a harder time keeping track of your expenses and sticking to your budget when you use a credit card, stop using it.Paying with cash instead of a credit card will allow you to visualize how much of your available funds you are spending on a given purchase.If you are able to stick to your budget when using a credit card, look for one that has no annual fee and will reward you with cash back or other incentives. Just make sure you always pay your bill on time or these incentives will not be worth the price you are paying in interest.\n",
            "Assess your daily or weekly spending habits.\n",
            "Once you have a solid grasp on what you are spending your money on, you can start cutting out expensive habits.Smoking is an extremely expensive habit that can also lead to expensive medical bills, so do whatever you can to quit.Buying coffee every day instead of making it yourself can really add up. If you don't like plain coffee, try searching online for recipes that are similar to the specialty coffee drinks you like to buy.Buying bottled water or other drinks is extremely expensive compared to refilling a reusable water bottle with tap water throughout the day.Buying lunch five days a week instead of bringing leftovers to work with you can be a real budget-killer. If you can't commit to bringing lunch every day, start by bringing lunch a few times a week.Playing the lottery on a regular basis is probably not a wise use of your money if your budget is tight.\n",
            "Buy used items.\n",
            "You can save on everything from your next car to furnishings for your home by buying gently used items.You can sometimes find really great clothes that have barely been worn at thrift shops for a fraction of the price.Don't forget about looking for electronics that have been refurbished by the manufacturer.If you are crafty, buy solid but ugly furniture at a yard sale or flea market and freshen it up with paint instead of splurging on a new piece.\n",
            "Look for monthly expenses that can be cut.\n",
            "If you pay for monthly memberships or subscriptions, carefully assess how much they cost, how much you use them, and whether you could give them up.Make sure you're not paying for services that you never use. For example, if you have premium cable channels that you never watch, you can cancel them without feeling like you are making any sacrifices. The same goes for your cell phone bill if you are paying for more data than you ever use.If you belong to a warehouse club, try to calculate how much you save on products by shopping there in order to determine if the membership cost is worth it.Look for less expensive alternatives if you do use the services. For example, if you go to the gym regularly, you probably shouldn't stop exercising to save a few bucks, but you may be able to find a cheaper gym to go to or even a less expensive membership option at the same gym.\n",
            "Compare items or brands when shopping.\n",
            "If you're on a tight budget, you want to make sure you're always getting the best deal on absolutely everything. Take some time to compare prices for items you purchase regularly and for large purchases.If you've had the same auto insurance carrier or cable company for a long time, there might be better deals out there, so be sure to comparison shop regularly.Shopping for necessities online can be cheaper in some instances, but make sure you take shipping charges into account.Use coupons to save some extra cash. Keep in mind that many retailers accept competitors' coupons.Be careful about driving long distances to save a small amount of money. You might end up spending more on gas to get there than you actually saved!Watch out for \"deals\" on items you weren't planning on buying in the first place. Even if the price is great, you will save more by not buying it at all.\n",
            "Ask for a better deal.\n",
            "You can always ask your service providers for better deals, especially if you've been a loyal customer. The worst they can say is no.Try this with your cable and internet providers, insurance companies, and cell phone carriers.\n",
            "Spend less on entertainment or at restaurants.\n",
            "Whether it's dining out or going to amusement parks, entertainment can eat up a big chunk of your budget. Look for less expensive ways to have fun.[3]Learn to cook at home and keep the fridge well stocked with ingredients for things that you know you can cook from scratch when you come home late and don't have much time to whip up a grand meal.Instead of going out to eat with friends, invite them over for a potluck.Look for free concerts and inexpensive shows in your area. You can also have a great time by simply walking around town!Don't feel like you need to buy a souvenir whenever you go to an event.If you like sporting events, try attending high school games instead of college or professional games.Always look for deals if you plan on going out. Lots of attractions offer discounts if you purchase your tickets online.\n",

            "Go green around the house to save money on your utility bills each month.Sealing up air gaps can reduce your heating and cooling bills. If you own your home, investing in a properly insulated attic can make a huge difference.Turning your heat down just a few degrees in the winter can make a big difference in your energy bills as well. A programmable thermostat will let you automate the temperature of your house so you won't spend money on heating the place to a comfortable level when you're not at home. (You still need to keep the house warm enough so that your pipes won't freeze.)When buying appliances, look for energy efficient options. You can also switch out incandescent light bulbs with LEDs to save some money on electricity.Always turn lights off when you leave a room and unplug electronics when they are not in use.\n",
            "Avoid bank and credit card fees.\n",
            "Choose your bank and credit card providers wisely in order to avoid unnecessary fees.[4]Make sure to only use the ATM at your bank if you will get charged for using outside ATMs.Avoid penalty charges by always paying your bills on time.Look for a bank or credit union that offers free checking and savings accounts.\n",
            "Aim to have a few no-spend days a month.\n",

            "Get a better job.\n",
            "If spending less is just not enough, it may be time to  get a better job that will allow you to  make more money. Start by  updating your resume, searching for listings online, and  networking with other professionals in your field.[5]Don't forget to look for advancement opportunities within your company.If you love your job and you feel that you deserve to make more money,  ask your boss for a raise.[6]If you don't have the skills to land the kind of job you really want, it may be worth it to go back to school.\n",

            "Using your skills to provide freelance or consulting services is a great way to earn additional income. If this won't work with your profession, get a part-time job or find creative ways to make some extra cash on the side.[7]You can make some extra money by performing jobs like mowing lawns, cleaning houses, or even walking dogs for people in your neighborhood.If you're artsy, try selling handmade items online or at local stores.If you love to write, you may be able to  make money blogging.Look for short-term gigs like focus groups, paid surveys, or mystery shopping.\n",
            "Sell stuff you don't need.\n",
            "You probably have at least a few possessions that you no longer need or want, and you can turn those items into extra cash by selling them to people who do want them.[8]If you have lots of unwanted items, try having a yard sale.For more valuable or specialized items, you can try selling them on eBay,  Craigslist, or other websites.If you have nice clothing that you no longer wear, think about bringing it to a consignment shop.

Then, it progresses on to more detailed questions to verify your eligibility for certification.Your application will be assessed by the local AIP on the basis of the following criteria: financial record and standing; staff qualifications and experience; identification and accessibility of premises; and security and procedures.Do not embellish or lie on a resume. For example, say you have five years of experience when you have only five months of experience.Do not say you went to a school, college, or prestigious high school if you did not go to it. The systems and teams can research and find out the truth.Do not try to bulk up a resume with a bunch of fillers. It's okay if it's a half-page resume if that's all you have at that time.

            "If you are an agency with multiple agents, then you must show that at least 1 of them has met the professional criteria to operate a business in your local area. If you are a solo agent, then you must submit your business license or copies of any other certifications that you've received. These documents serve as proof of qualifications.[2]For example, training courses can count towards showing a minimal level of experience and training required to become certified, as long as they were offered by the IATA. Scan in and submit copies of any training certifications.\n",

            "Create a good study space.\n",
            "The first step to studying harder is to create a study space for yourself. Studying in the same space each day is effective because your mind will learn to associate a particular space with work. It'll be easier to get into the flow of studying when entering your study space.Students who spend time struggling to find a space to study often waste valuable time. Having a space you go every day to study is helpful.[1]Choose a study space that is free of distractions. Find a space away from television and other noises. You should not study in bed or on the couch. Choose a place with a desk where you can sit upright to work.[2]Make sure the space is set up for what you need. If you need to prepare a class project with lots of small pieces that must be arranged, a large, uncluttered space with a worktable will be best. If you just need to read your textbook, a cozy chair and a cup of tea may be just fine.The best study space for you will depend in part on your learning style. For example, if you're a visual learner, working in a bright, colorful space might be helpful.[3]\n",
            "Stick to a study schedule.\n",
            "Once you've found a great space to study, create a study schedule for yourself. Having a regular study sessions will help you avoid procrastination and stick to your goals as a students. You should start planning your study schedule as you get your course syllabus -- that way, nothing will sneak up on you.You should strive to prioritize studying. Place study time ahead of extracurricular or social activities. Try to study shortly after class or school each day.[4]Schedule study sessions at roughly the same time each day. Having a regular schedule can help you stick to studying on a regular basis. Put these sessions into your calendar, just as you would a dentist appointment or soccer practice.[5]Start slow. At first, keep your study sessions between 30 and 50 minutes. After you've gotten used to this duration, push yourself to study for longer periods.Stop to take short breaks occasionally.[6] Studying for hours on end can cause stress. Take 10 minute breaks as you study.[7] Don't go longer than 2 hours without a break.\n",
            "Have specific goals for each study schedule.\n",
            "Studying without direction is not an effective way to learn and retain information. Go into each study session with specific goals in mind to try and make the most out of your study session.Keep your overall academic goal in mind. Branching off of that goal, break it down into manageable chunks and focus on each chunk per session.[8]For example, say you have to memorize 100 vocabulary words for your Spanish final. Aim to memorize 20 words per session over the course of 5 study sessions. Make sure to review old words at the beginning of each new study session to make sure the information stays fresh in your mind.\n",
            "Test yourself.\n",
            "A vital part of studying is repetition. Test yourself on difficult material during each study session. Make flashcards with vocabulary words, dates, and other facts. Use these to test your knowledge. If you have a math exam, do practice tests in your math book. If your teacher or professor provides practice exams, take as many as possible.Try to make your own practice tests. Review the types of question your teacher asked on quizzes and try to replicate them in your own words. Make a test for yourself, containing 10 to 20 questions, and then complete the test.If your teacher provides practice tests to help you study, take them home and do them on your own time.Start well ahead of time and bring in your practice test to show your teacher. Ask her something like, \"I've gone through my notes and made this practice exam to help me study for the test next week. Could you tell me if it's on the right track?\" Your teacher isn't likely to tell you whether or not specific things will be on the test, but she will probably be happy to tell you whether you're studying the right areas. And your hard work and preparation are sure to impress!\n",
            "Start with the hardest subjects.\n",
            "The most difficult subjects require the most mental energy. Start with this work first. After completing harder materials, studying easier subjects will feel a lot less stressful.[9]\n",
            "Use study groups effectively.\n",
            "Study groups can be a great way to maximize your studying experience and help you stay motivated.[10] However, keep in mind that you need to use study groups effectively in order for them to have the best effect.You should structure study groups as you would an individual study session. Choose which materials to focus on and have set timeframes and breaks. It's easy to get distracted if you're working with groups of people. A schedule can help you stay on task.[11]Work with people who you know are hard workers. Even the best planned study groups can fall apart if you choose to work with people who are distracting and procrastinate.\n",
            "Seek out help when you need it.\n",
            "Remember, there's no shame in asking for help if you need it. If you are continually struggling with a particular subject despite diligent studying, seek out help from another student, a tutor, a teacher, or a parent. If you're a college student, there might be free tutoring centers on campus dedicated to helping students with a particular subject like writing, language, or math.[12]\n",
            "Take breaks and give yourself rewards.\n",
            "As studying is seen as a chore, allowing yourself breaks and rewards can help motivate you to study harder. Take breaks every hour or so to stretch your legs, watch television, surf the internet, or do some light reading. Provide rewards at the end of study sessions to motivate yourself to work harder. For example, if you study 3 days in a row treat yourself by ordering take out.[13]\n",
            "Prepare your body and mind before studying.\n",
            "If you go straight from school to studying, you may feel burnt out and struggle to concentrate. Taking half an hour to prepare your mind and body for a study session can help you study more effectively.Go for a short walk before beginning to study. Stretching by walking can help your body loosen up and clear your mind in preparation of studying.[14]If you're hungry, eat before studying but stick to a light snack or a small meal. Eating a heavy meal before studying can result in sleepiness. This can make it difficult to concentrate on studying.[15]\n",
            "Study with the right mindset.\n",
            "The mindset you have going into studying can affect the effectiveness of your study session. Work on fostering a positive mindset going into each study session.Think positively when you study. Remind yourself that you are building new skills and abilities. Do not get discouraged if you struggle with something. Remind yourself you're studying because you need to improve so it's okay if you don't understand some material.[16]Do not engage in catastrophic or absolute thinking. Catastrophic thoughts include things like, \"If I don't get this now, I never will.\" Absolute thoughts are things like, \"I always do poorly on these exams.\" Instead, try to be realistic. Think to yourself, \"I'm struggling with this information at the moment, but if I'm persistent I'm sure it will come to me.\"[17]Do not compare yourself to others. You're focused on doing well on this assignment for yourself. Other people's success or failure should not matter.[18]\n",
            "Use memory games.\n",
            "Memory games, always known as mnemonic devices, are a means of remembering information by creating associations. They can be extremely helpful when it comes to smart studying.[19]Many people remember subjects by stringing words together to form sentences, the first letter of each word signifying part of a topic that requires memorization. For example, the sentence \"Kings play cards on fat green stools\" can be used to help remember the taxonomy ranking for animals: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.Make sure you use mnemonic devices that are easy to remember. If you're creating your own mnemonic device, pick words and sentences that have personal meaning to you and that you will easily remember later.\n",
            "Rewrite your notes.\n",
            "If you have notes, rewrite them. Rewriting the notes you have, changing the wording slightly, helps you actively engage with the material. You're not just repeating information but trying to explain it over and over again. This can help you process information and more easily remember it later on.[20]Don't just copy out the material over and over again. Instead, try to condense it to the most basic points. Then, try to condense it again, until you have gotten to the most essential points.\n",
            "Take good notes\n",
            ". Creating the proper resources for studying can help you. While you're in class, try to take good notes. These can serve as a valuable resource later on when you're studying.Organize your notes by date and subject. Write the date on the top corner of the page at the beginning of class. Then, write headings and subheadings regarding the subject being taught. If you're searching for notes on a particular subject, it'll be easier to find later.[21]Use your best handwriting. You want to make sure you can read your notes later on.[22]Compare notes with other classmates. If you missed one class session or missed a few words here and there when taking notes, another classmate can help you fill in what you missed.[23]\n",
            "Read actively\n",
            ". When reading material for class, make sure you read actively. How you read can affect how well you retain information later on.Pay attention to chapter titles and subheadings. These often offer clues as to the main point of a text. It indicates what material you should pay closest attention to while reading.[24]You should also reread the first sentence of each paragraph once. This sentence usually offers a summary of key information you'll need. Pay attention to concluding sections as well, as they summarize key materials.[25]If permitted, underline passages and write notes in margins summarizing key points. This can help you find important information later when studying.[26] Alternatively, you can use sticky notes to write notes down and mark important passages.[27]\n",
            "Ask questions.\n",
            "If you're confused about anything in class, ask questions. Usually, teachers will allow time for questions after class. You can also ask to stop by a students office hours to ask about topics that confuse you.[28]Do yourself a favor and make it a habit to visit your teacher's office hours starting at the beginning of the semester. Waiting to ask questions until the day before the test makes it seem like you haven't been preparing. Making a habit of dropping in once a week or so encourages your teacher to see you as a student who works hard and prepares in advance -- she'll be more likely to want to help you.\n",

            "How to Play Pachinko: A Beginner’s Guide\n",
            "Put your money in the machine.\n",
            "Insert cash or a prepaid card into the pachinko machine. The cash will buy you a certain number of balls, which should be listed on the machine. You will buy a certain number of balls at a selected monetary values for the game. If playing an offline game, put money into the money slot on the ball dispenser that you find on the machines left-hand side.Think of the balls like a casino's chips. They stand in for real money, just not money you can collect at the parlor.\n",
            "Press the ball-release button.\n",
            "The ball-release button is called the tamakashi button. When you press the button the balls will fall into the tray at the top of your machine. This tray is called the uwazara. Those are the balls you have to play with, which are technically \"borrowed\" from the parlor.If the balls don't come out or it doesn't seem like what you paid for, you can ask an attendant to help you.\n",
            "Turn the handle.\n",
            "You start playing in pachinko by pulling the handle that is on the machines lower right. Youll want to turn the handle firmly by twisting it. The amount you twist controls how fast the balls shoot out the top. You want to find the right angle to aim the balls towards the hole near the bottom of the machine. If the balls don't enter the hole, you lose them to a chute below. Keep twisting to find the best speed for the balls. Try to aim for about 20 balls in the hole for every 1,000 yen you're spending.The more strongly you turn the handle to the right, the faster the balls come out.If you dont turn the handle strongly enough or far enough, the balls wont move. If you turn the handle too strongly, the balls will go right into the losing shoot at the bottom.\n",
            "Try to go through the gaps.\n",
            "Part of pachinko is avoiding the pegs on the board, which can make your balls go off course. When turning the wheel, try to get the balls between the gaps as much as possible so they fall easily into the winning hole.You can launch the balls singly.Each board has about 500 pegs that you must guide your balls through.[1]\n",
            "Watch for the doors.\n",
            "Another part of pachinko is the small doors that surround the hole, one one each side. When they are shut, you'll only be able to get one ball through. When they open, you'll be able to get three balls through at once. The balls that go in reward you with more balls, as well as giving you a spin on the slot machine.\n",
            "Play the slot machine.\n",
            "The slot machine uses numbers, which you need to line up. You are looking for a three in a row. Of course, you want three in a row, but you also want a situation called a reach, where you are waiting for the third number to show up after having two in a row. You'll see reach happen about a fourth of the time. When it does, you'll have the number you want represented on the screen, battling against another number you don't want. Usually, these numbers are represented by various silly characters that literally battle across the screen.If the other number wins, which usually happens, you lose. However, the fun happens when your number wins in a reach. When it does, each ball you've already won is converted to ten balls, or the machine will pay out a huge amount of balls.\n",
            "Use pachinko etiquette.\n",
            "Pachinko is a very popular game in Japan, so an entire set of etiquette rules have popped up. Its best to follow them if you are playing the game in its home country, as you can upset people if you don't. Don't gloat over winnings or look sad when you lose, as you are playing close by other people, and generally, everyone keeps a poker face. Most people don't want to be disturbed by the people around them. They view the game as something they do alone, not together.Make sure not to touch anyone else's balls, as it's considered bad luck and bad form.If you need to reserve a machine, use a pack of cigarettes or some other marker, and place it in the tray, which will work for about half an hour.Don't take children with you.\n",
            "Empty the winnings box.\n",
            "If you hit a jackpot, which is called an aotari, the machine will spit out balls into your lower tray. Once you have a lot or it seems to be overflowing, you need to empty it into your winnings box with the lever at the bottom.Never move the winnings box yourself. If it's full, you need to call a staff member, who will come move it for you. Usually, the person will set it behind you on the floor. You'll also get a new winnings box if you're still playing.Each box of balls is usually worth about 5,000 yen.\n",
            "End your game.\n",
            "Once you're done, you need to collect any money you still have on your card, which you can do by pressing the card/coin return button. It should eject your card for you to take with you. Remember, like any gambling game, it's best to quit while you're ahead.\n",
            "Call the staff.\n",
            "Once again, you never touch the winning boxes of balls, mostly because no one wants to pick up thousands of balls. If you don't have a call button, make a big X with your arms to show the staff you're done. The staff member will come over and pick up your balls for you and take them to the counting machine.\n",
            "Collect your tokens or cards.\n",
            "Because playing pachinko for money is technically illegal in Japan, you only get tokens or cards at the pachinko parlor. Once your balls are counted, the staff will hand you your tokens. Keep them in a safe place. Just like in casinos, the balls represent a certain amount of money. However, unlike casinos, you have one extra step in the exchange. Think of it like converting money. You are converting balls to tokens to yen.\n",
            "Exchange your tokens at a tuck shop.\n",
            "Once you've gathered your tokens, you must go elsewhere to find a tuck shop, where you can exchange your tokens for yen. Because playing pachinko for money is illegal, the staff at the parlor won't tell you where to look. However, you can ask another friendly pachinko player where to go. Once there, you won't find people to convert your tokens. Rather, you'll find a drawer. You'll be able to pick it out because it usually has Astroturf.You place your tokens in, and the drawer is drawn in. In return, it comes out with your yen, and you leave.Often, the tuck shop is a small shed located near the pachinko parlor. Sometimes, in place of a drawer, you will find hole in the sheds wall where you retrieve the money.\n",
            "Recognize a pachinko machine.\n",
            "Pachinko has been described as a vertical pinball machine. The goal of the game is to fire balls that fall through a maze of metal pins into a hole. The balls that go through let you play a slot machine with the chance of winning more balls. It's partially a game of skill and partially a game of chance.The small steel balls are smaller than those in most pinball machines. They are shot into a vertical playing field.[2]You'll find three types of Pachinko machines: novice, intermediate, and advanced.[3]\n",
            "Find a pachinko parlor.\n",
            "In Japan, entire arcades are devoted to pachinko. They are often referred to as pachinko parlors. They are located all throughout Tokyo, as pachinko is a popular game in Japan.At popular parlors, you might even see lines outside some Pachinko parlors in the mornings, as professional pachinko players and others line up early to get in.\n",
            "Play to win.\n",
            "On top of every machine, you'll find statistics about how many wins and losses the machine has had. Consult these statistics to help you choose machines, as you want to pick ones with the best odds of winning. On top of the machine, look for a set of numbers. One number will be smaller than the other. That number is how many times the machine has won, while the bigger one is how many spins it has had. Both numbers only represent the day's spins.You want a machine that hasn't that many wins with a large number of spins because machines tend to win in waves.You dont want a machine that won 25 times yesterday and many times the day before because it probably wont give you much today.Try not to spend more than 500-1,000 yen ($5 - $10) on any one machine, and dont play in an empty parlor.

            "This is the start of the cleansing process.\n",
            "Not only does it cleanse your crystals spiritually, but its also a nice way to wash off dust and grime that may have accumulated. Bring your crystals over to the sink and rinse them under running water for about 1 minute, scrubbing them gently with your fingertips.[1][2]Cleansing your crystals before charging them leaves them more open and receptive to energy.If you have a crystal thats too large or bulky to rinse under water, you can cleanse it by sounding a single tonal pitch nearby for 5 to 10 minutes. Try using a tuning fork or a singing bowl to make this process easier.Don't do this with stones like malachite, selenite, black tourmaline, angelite, celestine, kyanite, or any finely-grained crystal.[3]\n",
            "Cleansing your crystals washes away any negative energy.\n",
            "After youve rinsed them in water, give them a good dunk in a bowl of water to clean them once and for all. Try to cleanse your crystals about once a month, or more often if other people handle them a lot. If you have any crystals that you wear on your person (like in jewelry), try to cleanse them as soon as you get home for the day.[4]If youve had crystals for years and youve never cleansed them, thats okay! Its better to start now than never at all.\n",
            "A full moon is widely regarded as the best time to charge crystals.\n",
            "Since the moon is at its biggest and brightest, your crystals will have access to the most moonlight and energy possible. Its also best to wait for a clear, cloudless night so that your crystals can bathe in direct moonlight all night.[5]If you cant wait for a full moon, thats okay too! Charging your crystals in moonlight, no matter what cycle its in, will be beneficial.\n",
            "A waxing moon is the universes sign to keep moving.\n",
            "If you charge your crystals when the moon is actively moving toward a full moon, you can set intentions about your goals and work toward achieving them. This is a great time to charge your crystals if youre making any big life changes or youre feeling stuck and stagnant.[6]Try making plans for the month while your crystals are charging in the waxing moon. You might find it easier to make decisions and stick to them during this time.\n",
            "A waning moon is your sign to let some things go.\n",
            "After the new moon, the moon starts to get smaller in the sky. Usually, this is a symbol of downsizing or reflecting upon your relationships and any negativity in your life. If you charge your crystals during a waning moon, you might set intentions to confront toxicity or bad relationships and move on from the past.[7]If youve already confronted negativity or toxicity in your life, you might use this time to prepare yourself for the positivity coming your way.\n",
            "Make sure theyre in a spot where the moonlight can hit them directly.\n",
            "If you dont want to leave your crystals outside, place them on your windowsill where the light can hit them. You can set them out on their own, or you can place them on a dish or a cloth so they dont get dirty on the ground.[8]Some people set their crystals on charging dishes, or dishes made of crystal. It can help balance uneven-shaped crystals that might roll away on flat ground.\n",
            "When you place your crystals outside, say your intentions out loud.\n",
            "As they charge throughout the night (or whenever you think of it), keep thinking about your intentions and direct your energy toward the crystals. The more energy you put out, the more energy your crystals will take from the moonlight.[9][10]You might say things like, I will confront my negative relationship and work toward creating positive connections.Or, I will set my goals and stick to them for the next month.You can also thank your crystals by saying things like, Thank you for providing energy and healing for me in the past month.\n",
            "Try to grab them before the sun comes up.\n",
            "Sunlight can fade the color of some crystals, which is why a lot of people prefer to charge them in the moonlight. When you wake up in the morning, gather your crystals and take them back inside to wherever you keep them. In another month or so, you can cleanse and charge your crystals again.[11]If you want to, you can leave your crystals to charge in the sunlight, too. However, its not totally necessary, and it can cause some of the brighter-colored crystals to fade faster.\n",

            "Determine where you want to construct a concrete patio, how large it will be, and its exact dimensions.\n",
            "The size of the patio determines the amount of concrete required and whether you will need a mixer. If the patio is too large in area, it might not be an easy DIY job. The location is also important. You want to choose a mostly even area so you don't have to level the uneven ground before you lay the concrete.Check local building codes to find out if a permit is required, how far the patio has to be from property and house lines, or any other county or city regulations.Before you dig anywhere in your yard, find out where septic tanks, underground lines, or other utilities are located.\n",
            "Drive stakes into the corners of the patio area.\n",
            "Tie string between the stakes and use a line level to determine the slope. The stakes and string will give you a good picture of how the patio will fit in your back yard. Adjust the area if needed.Cutting the stakes to a pointed end may make them easier to drive into the ground.[1]If the ground is uneven, you have two choices: build up the low side or dig the high side out.[2]\n",
            "Remove all weeds, grass, roots, and topsoil from the roped off area.\n",
            "This can be done with a hoe, a shovel, or other common gardening tools.\n",
            "Decide if you want your patio to be level with the ground or raised.\n",
            "Dig 4 inches (about 10 cm) deep for raised and 8 inches (20.3 cm) deep for level.Compact the earth if necessary.If you're planning on having something extremely heavy such as a brick barbecue on your patio, your first step will be to pour a concrete foundation for added stability.\n",
            "Add a layer of gravel or crushed rock to the compacted earth.\n",
            "Typically, this base will be 4 inches (about 10 cm) deep.[3]Ensure the gravel or crushed rock is compacted and laid evenly. Fluctuation in the height of the base can cause shifting or cracking in the patio over time.\n",
            "Drive stakes around the new perimeter of your patio, spaced at least 2 feet (.6 m) apart.\n",
            "These stakes should be slightly outside your original stakes. They will be used in a later step to help support the outer edge of your patio.Make sure the stakes are firmly embedded in the ground.Patios need to slope to allow for water runoff. The standard slope is 1/8\" per foot. Check your local building codes for the exact slope dimensions.Don't underestimate the heaviness of wet concrete. Use very sturdy wood or it could bend or even break under the weight. Consider using steel concrete forms to avoid this problem.\n",
            "Cut 2x4s to make the frame.\n",
            "The frame (also called the form) holds the concrete. Cut the 2x4 to the length so that the inside dimensions are equal to the patio area.[4] The form will be removed after the patio is finished, so you want to make sure you don't count the edge of the frame into your dimensions; if you do this, the patio will be smaller than you originally intended.\n",
            "Line the 2x4s with the string border of the patio.\n",
            "When you insert the board into your patio site, they should be aligned directly underneath the string. Remember, the 2x4s are acting as the outer walls of your patio, so make sure you place them in the correct space.\n",
            "Nail the 2x4 to the stakes.\n",
            "The stakes are the form's support so it doesn't bend against the concrete. Make sure the stakes, nails, and forms are sturdy. Use nails that are long and strong enough.You can also use screws instead of nails. This requires a screwdriver.While you are nailing each four forms to the stakes, make sure the forms are level. Use the string or a level to ensure the forms are level. If the forms are not level, you might end up with uneven concrete.\n",
            "Saw off tops of the stakes.\n",
            "The stakes should be just below the edge of the forms. They should not be visible above the concrete.If pouring concrete next to a house, other slab of concrete, or other structure, place an isolation joint between the concrete and the existing surface.[5] An isolation joint allows the concrete to move and minimizes cracking. Isolation joints are usually made by adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting or Iso-strip-off to the wall or surface your concrete will touch. The adhering asphalt-impregnated fiber sheeting and Iso-strip-off can be found at most home improvement stores.[6]\n",
            "Coat the form boards with vegetable oil or a commercial releasing agent.\n",
            "This assures that the concrete won't adhere to your boards so they can be removed after the concrete has finished setting.\n",
            "Mix the concrete.\n",
            "This can be done by hand or with a mixer. Always follow the directions on the bags of concrete. They will list how much water you need and how you should mix it.[7]You can calculate the number of bags you will need by determining the cubic yards of the patio site. Multiply the thickness, the width, and the height of the area to determine how many bags you will need. You can also use a concrete calculator like this.If mixing by hand, you can put the concrete mix into a mortar tub or a wheelbarrow. Mix with a shovel or a hoe. Make sure that when mixing concrete by hand you wear gloves and protective eye wear.If using a mixer, make sure you can move the mixer into the area where you are building the patio. Do this before you begin the project.The amount of concrete needed for the project should determine whether you can mix by hand or with a mixer.\n",
            "Pour the concrete.\n",
            "Do this all at once to avoid independent shifting and settling of slabs.If using a wheelbarrow, make a ramp so you can pour the concrete into the area. Make sure the ramp does not move or disturb the forms. Ramps can be made with 2x4s or other long pieces of wood.Getting help from others will help with this step. Have someone shovel out the concrete as you hold the wheelbarrow.\n",
            "Push the concrete into all corners with a shovel.\n",
            "Concrete is heavy, so make sure to dump it close to where you want it. If the area is large, you might want to use a longer tool to spread hard to reach inside areas, or wear rubber boots to walk in the concrete as you spread.\n",
            "Use a flat piece of wood or aluminum screed (a long 2x4) to level the top of the concrete.\n",
            "Work from one end of the patio to the other in a sawing motion. It is important to do the sawing motion over the entire patio because it will lower the gravel and make the next steps easier.  Do not drag the 2x4 over the patio because it will not lower the gravel.[8]This is easiest done with another person.\n",
            "Use a bull float to smooth the concrete surface.\n",
            "Move the float back and forth to smooth the patio and to fill in low spots.Water will float to the surface during this process. Wait until the water disappears to finish the patio.\n",
            "Put on the finishing touches.\n",
            "Using an edger, slide it between the forms and the concrete to create a rounded edge. When the concrete can support your weight, cut grooves in the concrete every 8 feet (2.4m). These are control joints that help if the concrete shifts or changes over time. The final step is to hand float the concrete with a steel or magnesium float to finish smoothing the surface out.\n",
            "Let the concrete cure for at least two days.\n",
            "Cover the concrete with plastic or a curing compound to ensure it stays moist. After the concrete cures, remove the form boards. Be careful during this process; you don't want to chip your newly laid concrete.\n",

            "Communicate your expectations to them clearly.\n",
            "Let your teenager know exactly what you expect them to do and not do. This will reduce conflict, and it will help your teenager understand their responsibilities. Try to express these boundaries in loving ways. You might:Ask them to do manageable tasks. For example, instead of telling them \"can you clean up?\", ask them, \"Can you wash the dishes tonight?\"Give them two clear choices. For example, you might say, \"You can either go to the movie tonight with your friends or sleep over at their house on Friday.\"Ask them to state the consequences of their actions. For example, you might say, \"what do you think will happen if you miss too many of your classes?\"\n",
            "Allow them levels of independence.\n",
            "Slowly support your teen in developing their independence as they mature. For example, let your younger teen choose how to decorate their room and style their hair. Older teens may be able to use the car, attend activities without an adult, or hold a part-time job.A controlling parent may face increased conflict with a teen who seeks independence. Ask your teen what independence theyd like and come to some compromises.[1]\n",
            "Accept their social needs.\n",
            "Teens are often concerned with social relationships, fitting in with peers, and making social decisions such as whether to use drugs or engage in sexual activity.[2]  They will likely want to spend more time with friends than with their family. While its important for them to be a part of the family, make sure that you respect their need to engage in friendships, be with friends, and create their social identity.Allow your teen to join clubs or groups or do other social activities (such as go to the skate park, join sports teams, or hang out with friends).Ask your teenager about their friends, and try to learn their names. Before they hang out, meet their friends in person if you can.\n",
            "Respect their privacy.\n",
            "Teens want increasing independence and this includes needs for privacy, too. It might feel like your teen is tuning you out or ignoring you, but they are likely wanting some space to be alone (or with friends). Respect their desire for privacy and consider giving them increased privacy as they get older.[3]If your teen isnt forthright in talking to you or wants to spend less time with you, dont take it personally and instead, see it is a developmental stage. You do, however, get the final say in their activities and should look out for their safety.\n",
            "Recognize their sleep habits.\n",
            "Its natural for teens to fall asleep later (after 11 p.m.) and sleep in the next morning.[4] Be mindful of these sleep patterns, but also encourage them to get adequate sleep. Not getting enough sleep can affect their moods, memory, and concentration.If your teen struggles to get restful sleep, remove electronic devices from their bedrooms (cell phones, televisions, tablets, etc) so that the light does not stimulate them instead of relaxing them.[5]A consistent bedtime can also help with getting more restful sleep.\n",
            "Let them make their own mistakes.\n",
            "No matter how many warnings you give, teens often prefer to learn experientially. Some teens may need to fail or make mistakes in order to learn from them and be responsible. As a parent, its difficult to watch your child fail. Let them know that you support them, love them, and you will be there for them, no matter the outcome.[6]Be there to comfort your teen when they are disappointed, even if you want to say, I told you so.\n",
            "Listen actively to your teen.\n",
            "If you remember being a teenager, then you probably remember that it wasnt easy. If your teen is complaining about their difficulties, dont immediately brush them off or say, I had it worse. Instead, listen in. While their problems may sound trivial to you, they feel big to your teen. Practice empathy by hearing them out and imagining yourself in their place.Relate to how problems can feel big even when they are small.\n",
            "Ask questions to show interest.\n",
            "One of the best ways to build connections and understand your teen is by being curious and asking questions. Dont pester your teen, but show curiosity toward them and ask them about their interests, friends, goals, and dreams. When asking questions, keep them open-ended. For example, instead of asking, Did you have a good day at school? say, What activities did you enjoy at school today?[7]When your teen does share with you, listen and respond thoughtfully.Have regular and frequent conversations with your child. Talking together should be a daily activity.\n",
            "Spend quality time together.\n",
            "While your teenager may be becoming their own person, you should still look for opportunities to spend time together. Look for activities that aren't connected to their schoolwork or extracurriculars. You can:Eat dinner together every nightPlay boardgamesDo a craft projectTake a hikeGo on a family vacationVisit a local festival\n",
            "Support their activities.\n",
            "Whether your child is a star athlete or master chess player, support the activities that interest them, even if they interest you very little. Understanding their likes and interests can give you a glimpse into their life. If youre concerned or dont understand their interests, do some research and learn about them.Find ways to support their chosen activities. Attend athletic games, go to plays, and support their after-school activities.\n",
            "Recognize cultural influences.\n",
            "Teens want to have a unique identity, yet also want to fit in and feel accepted by their peers. Feeling included (via sports, clothes, music, or interests) aids in their sense of belonging. They may also look up to athletes, academics, or actors as role models on how to talk or dress.[8]Teens might look to social media and the internet for whats acceptable or how to fit in.Spend some time watching television shows your teen enjoys or get to know the activities they like. Do activities together that your teen enjoys.\n",
            "Let them express their emotions.\n",
            "Adults often tell teens to stop sulking or being upset or angry, but let your teen express their emotions. If they avoid their feelings or stuff them down, they will likely come out in a more negative way later. Teens are learning how to identify and manage their emotions, so allow them to do this. Its important for them to recognize and accept their feelings as they happen and find ways to release their emotions, like talking to a friend.[9]Remind your teen that there are no good or bad emotions, but there are good and bad ways of dealing with them.\n",
            "Tell them that you love them no matter what happens.\n",
            "Your teenager may worry that you will judge them or become angry when they make a mistake. Let them know that while you may not agree with all of their decisions, you will still love them no matter what.Try not to expect perfection out of your teenager. Part of life is making mistakes, and your teenager may make a few as they grow up. Help them learn from these mistakes without judging them.\n",
            "Be sensitive to their moods.\n",
            "Give teens space to manage their emotions on their own. Leave them be in their room or back off after arguments.

            "Set yourself up for success by planning your first year.\n",
            "While Stardew Valley is an expansive game that lets you do almost anything you want, if you want to make a lot of money quickly you should plan out your first year to maximize the amount of progress you can make, as the items that help you earn more money are available later in the game.Spring: Your goals for Spring are to build a Chicken Coop (to get access to eggs so you can make Mayonnaise), get to level 90 in the Mines, and plant strawberries after the Egg Festival. You'll only get two Strawberry harvests, but if you use Speed-Gro Fertilizer you can increase this to three harvests.Summer: In the Summer you should aim to grow multi-harvest crops (like blueberries and hops) and to craft more sprinklers, as sprinklers greatly help cut down on your watering time every morning.Fall: By Fall you should be able to unlock the Greenhouse (complete the Pantry Bundle in the Community Center)[1] and the Bus Stop (complete the Vault Bundles in the Community Center)[2]. You should also make tappers (to get resin from oak trees, an important ingredient for cask making) and iridium sprinklers.Winter: Focus on finishing the Community Center (if you didn't go the JojaMart route) and work on mining in the Skull Cavern.\n",
            "Collect as many forageables as you can.\n",
            "When you first start out, you won't be able to generate much passive income at first, so you should sell almost anything you collect. Try to collect as many forageables as possible to sell, but make sure you save at least one of each for the Community Center. Don't forget to check the Beach for items that washed up on the beach.If you find a forageable that is better than normal quality (no stars), sell those. These items are worth more money, and most of the Community Center bundles don't require a certain quality of item.\n",
            "Plant and grow the mixed seeds you find.\n",
            "When clearing out fiber on your farm, you'll likely find a lot of mixed seeds. These seeds can be planted and will grow into a variety of seasonal crops that can then be soldor if you get lucky, you might get a Community Center bundle item. Though you won't make a lot of money off of growing Mixed Seeds, it's pure profit since the seeds are free.\n",
            "Check the Help Wanted board outside Pierre's shop.\n",
            "Villagers will post various ads throughout the year offering to pay gold for various items. While you should do as many want ads as you can, you should focus on growing the following crops for Help Wanted ads that pop up in each season:Spring: Grow cauliflower, which can get you up to 525 gold per request.Summer: Grow melons. Villagers might put up an ad for a melon for a 750 gold reward, and Demetrius will ask by mail to buy one for 550 gold.Fall: Grow pumpkins, as these are the highest-paid requests during the season. A pumpkin request can net you up to 960 gold.\n",
            "Fish as much as possible.\n",
            "Fishing is one of the best ways to earn money early in the game, and many Community Center bundles require fish. While the fishing minigame can be a little bit difficult at first, the more Fishing skill you get, the easier it becomes.\n",
            "Check garbage cans.\n",
            "While you usually find junk in trash cans, sometimes you find useful things, including items you can use to fill out Community Center bundles or sell for extra money.[3] Just make sure there are no other villagers within a 15x15 tile square (with your character at the center) as they will get offended and lose 25 friendship points with you. The one exception is Linus, who will gain 5 friendship points if he sees you digging through the garbage.\n",
            "Select the best crops to grow to maximize your profit.\n",
            "Crops that grow all season are a better choice, as it saves you time from having to replant seeds. Note that while you're trying to finish the Community Center, make sure to grow the crops that are required for your bundles as well. You should also grow various crops to fulfil Help Wanted ads.Spring: Strawberries (8 days grow time, then 4 days to regrow), cauliflower (12 days grow time), and potatoes (6 days grow time). Strawberry seeds can only be purchased at the Egg Festival, but you can buy extra seeds and hold on to them until next year or you can put a Strawberry in a seed maker to get more seeds. Cauliflower can turn into a giant crop, and there's a chance you'll get an extra potato for each plant you harvest.Summer: Blueberries (13 days grow time, then 4 days to regrow), melon (12 days grow time), hops (11 days grow time, then one day to regrow), and starfruit (13 days grow time). Blueberries and hops are good resources for making artisan goods. Melons can turn into a giant crop, and starfruit are very valuable (though a little tricky to get seeds for).Fall: Cranberries (7 days grow time, then 5 days to regrow), pumpkin (13 days grow time). Like many other multi-harvest crops, cranberries drop multiple items when harvested. Pumpkins can turn into a giant crop.\n",
            "Use your crops to make artisan goods.\n",
            "Once you have artisan equipment unlocked and you have the materials to make them, you should shift focus from selling crops to using them to make artisan goods.

Unless you're focusing heavily on animals, Tiller is the best option for level 5. And the 40% profit increase on artisan goods from Artisan is a huge boost.Mining: Select Miner at level 5 and Blacksmith at level 10. The caveat is that if you select Blacksmith, you must sell iridium bars once you don't need them anymore. If you don't want to sell iridium bars, you should select Prospector. If you want to use Crystalariums, you should select Geologist and then Gemologist to increase your gem profits.Foraging: Select Gatherer at level 5 and Botanist at level 10. While you may not be foraging items much near the end of the game, finding high-quality forageables is preferred to the other occupation choices for the Foraging skill.Fishing: Select Fisher at level 5 and Angler at level 10. These two choices increase the amount your fish sell for, which is a huge boost as some fish can sell for quite a bit of money (especially if you get high-quality fish).Combat: Select Fighter at level 5 and Brute at level 10. These professions deal more damage to enemies, which helps you defeat them faster so you can get back to mining (which is what earns you money in the Mines).\n",

Crystalariums replicate any gem or mineral placed inside of it, so if you have a whole host of Crystalariums, you can replicate Diamonds for a huge profit.Crystalariums aren't unlocked until you've purchased the 25,000 gold bundle from the Community Center, so it may take some time to get one.\n",

            "3 Ways to Treat Canine Corneal Ulcers - wikiHow\n",
            "Watch for your dog rubbing his eye.\n",
            "Since corneal ulcers are painful, the dogs eye will bother him because it hurts. This means your dog may rub his eye. Your dog might also squint with the affected eye and hold it partially closed. The discomfort and pain from the ulcer may also cause your dogs eye to water.Your dog might do this by rubbing the affected side of the face along the ground or rubbing at the eye with a paw.[1]To figure out if your dog is squinting, look at the dogs face. If one eye looks smaller than the other, then the dog may be squinting.If you suspect your dog has a corneal ulcer, put an Elizabethan collar on it so it can't scratch its eye anymore.[2]\n",
            "Watch for red or cloudy eyes.\n",
            "If your dog has a corneal ulcer, the white part of the eye may be red or have a pinkish color. The surface of the cornea is usually clear, but if your dog has an ulcer it may have a cloudy or milky appearance. This might look like a film over the eye.[3]\n",
            "Monitor for discharge.\n",
            "If your dog has a corneal ulcer, he may also have a discharge from the eye. The discharge may be bloody or even pus-filled. This discharge may gather in the corner of the eye, nearest to his nose.Sometimes the area beneath the affected eye may be wet or damp.\n",
            "Look for eye sensitivity.\n",
            "Because of the pain and discomfort of the eye, your dog may have a new sensitivity to light. He may shy away from bright lights, or squint in bright areas.Your dog may also keep the affected eye closed.[4]Your dog may also flinch if he goes from a darker inside to bright sunshine outside.\n",
            "Take your dog to the vet.\n",
            "To get a proper diagnosis for your dog, you need to take him to the vet. The vet will perform an examination of both eyes to determine which eye is the problem, what is wrong with it, and how inflamed or sore it may be. The vet will probably also examine the eyelids and eyelashes to look for rubbing on the surface of the cornea, such as an inturned eyelash.[5]As well as treating the ulcer, it is important to correct any underlying health problems, such as dry eye or underactive thyroid glands, to prevent the problem recurring. Your vet may perform a full examination to determine if your dog has any other problems related to the ulcer.\n",
            "Treat the ulcer with medicine.\n",
            "Your vet needs to inspect the eye and record the size, shape, and depth of the ulcer. If the ulcer is superficial and only affecting the epithelial layer, such as a minor scratch, then all that may be needed is a drop to keep the surface of the eye moist so that healing can take place.[6]For ulcers affecting the stroma, an antibiotic drop is prescribed to prevent infection and keep the eye moist.[7] However the antibiotic is only effective for a few hours at a time and so needs to be reapplied every four to six hours, or as advised by your veterinarian. #*Most ulcers heal within five to seven days, and slower healing than this can be indicative of a problem.Sometimes the vet fits a special 'bandage' contact lens in the affected eye. This aids healing as it keeps moisture in and dust out, and can speed up the recovery time.\n",
            "Undergo additional treatment for any complications.\n",
            "One complication that prevents an ulcer healing is if a rim of damaged epithelia clings to the edge of the ulcer. The cornea heals by sending in new cells from the side, and epithelia tags act as a barrier through which the healing cells cannot pass. If the vet diagnoses this complication, he or she will use a cotton tip to gently rub the surface of the eye and abrade away the unwanted cells. This should then let healing continue.[8]On some occasions, ulcers can be problematic to heal, especially those in Boxers where there is an underlying anatomical problem with the glue holding the layers together. In these cases, the vet may put drops of local anesthetic into the eye and then perform a minor procedure call a grid keratotomy. This involves making tiny partial thickness puncture holes with a hypodermic needle, through the layers of the cornea. This then provides a key for the healing cells to cling onto to allow healing to take place.On rare occasions, the ulcer is so deep that Descemet's membrane is the last line of defence and it bulges outward. This is potentially very serious because if the membrane ruptures the eye will perforate. This requires a specialist procedure whereby a surgeon grafts a flap of cornea from another part of the eye to cover and repair the hole.\n",
            "Learn what a corneal ulcer is.\n",
            "The transparent layer that is the cornea is made up of three layers. The top layer, which is exposed to the air, is the epithelial layer. Beneath this is the middle and thickest layer, which is called the stromal layer, and at the bottom is a tough lining membrane called Descemet's membrane.[9] Corneal ulcers can be of any depth.A superficial scratch or abrasion only affects the epithelial layer and often heals quickly. An ulcer is deeper and typically erodes down through the epithelia and into the stroma, which is the main structural layer. If the ulcer eats deeper still through the complete thickness of the stroma, then only the thin Descemet's membrane is left to stop the eye from perforating, which is potentially very serious.[10]It is not possible to tell with the naked eye which layers of the eye are affected. It requires special stains and magnification, and therefore if you suspect damage on the surface of your dog's eye, a vet trip is essential.\n",
            "Identify the causes of a corneal ulcer.\n",
            "The most common cause of a corneal ulcer is trauma, such as a scratch to the surface of the eye or grit that got in and rubbed around. Anything that impacts the health of the eye can weaken its ability to respond to injury and predispose to ulcers. This includes conditions such as Cushing's disease, underactive thyroid glands, and diabetes.Some dogs suffer from a condition called dry eye where they are unable to produce adequate tear fluid to moisturize the cornea, which leads to it drying out and ulcer formation.[11]Some breeds, such as the Boxer, suffer from a lack of cohesiveness between the cells of the cornea, which leads to them flaking away and ulcer formation.\n",
            "Identify which breeds are prone to corneal ulcers.\n",
            "Some breeds are more prone to corneal ulcers than other dogs. Breeds with large bulbous eyes, such as Pekingese, pugs, and other squash-faced breeds, are inclined to develop ulcers since their eyes provide a large surface area of cornea exposed to the air.These dogs also get in-turned eyelashes due to the shape of their eyes. This can scour the surface each time the animal blinks, leading to ulcer formation.\n",

            "Holding it up and at your sides will inevitably knock seated passengers on their arms, shoulders, and heads. You can pull it along if it has wheels.\n",
            "Utilize the overhead space above your seat row.\n",
            "Do not place your bags overhead at the front of the plane unless you are sitting in that row. Please, don't put your bag in a bin near the front of the plane for a quick exit -- it means someone else will have to wait until the entire plane has emptied to walk back to get their bag. Taking the storage space of other passengers is rude and can delay departure as they search for storage.\n",
            "Avoid hogging the aisle.\n",
            "Remember that space is limited on board. Always be swift and alert while putting things in the overhead lockers, as other people need aisle space to get around you and to their seats. Place the items that you will frequently use in your seat back pocket or under the seat in front of you.\n",
            "Take care when retrieving luggage from the overhead compartment!\n",
            "It may be positioned to fall on you or someone else. If you have a lot of bulky, heavy luggage in the overhead bin, wait until others have left before standing and blocking other people from leaving the plane (they may have another flight to get to), or ask somebody to help you get your luggage down while everybody is waiting to leave the plane. This will help with traffic flow and allow all passengers to leave the plane as fast as possible.\n",
            "Keep your chair upright at least until you're told it can be reclined.\n",
            "Don't lean your chair back as soon as you get on. If you do decide to recline your chair when you can, do it slowly. Otherwise, you risk bumping the head of the unsuspecting passenger behind you who's getting something from the bag at their feet, or you could knock over the drink on their tray. Remember to return the seat to the upright position during the meal and drink servings, or if possible, wait until food and beverages are finished being served and cleaned up.\n",
            "Check behind youis that person tall, or do they have a child on their lap?\n",
            "If so, consider keeping your seat upright out of consideration, especially if it's a short flight. By reclining, you're taking space away from the passenger behind you; you may be more comfortable but at someone else's expense. You can also ask them if reclining your seat would be all right. If you can't make yourself comfortable without reclining, do your best to choose an aisle, bulkhead, or exit row seat when booking the flight so the person behind you has extra space.\n",
            "Choose a bulkhead or exit row seat if you're a tall/big person or have a child on your lap and know that having the seat in front of you reclined will make you uncomfortable, (unless you have a child, in which case you should never choose an exit row seat).\n",
            "Not only will you have more space, but the person in front of you will also have more space and may decide not to recline their seat out of consideration for you. If you sit in the middle, however, the person in front of you is cramped, as well, and will probably want to recline their seat, whether you like it or not.\n",
            "Keep an eye on any children you're traveling with.\n",
            "Children tend to bump, kick, or yank the seat in front of them without realizing it throughout the flight, which can make the person in front of them very uncomfortable. It's difficult enough to control some children on a long flight, but it's even more difficult to deal with an angry passenger in front of you.If your child/ren has/ve difficulty flying, do everything you can to relax the child/ren so you do not disturb other passengers nearby. Bring plenty of books, games, snacks, and other things to keep your child/ren quietly occupied.You can also try walking to the galley area of the plane to stretch your child's legs.Change diapers in the restroom on the plane. In most restrooms, there are changing tables and trash bins for diaper disposal.When breastfeeding, use a drape, both for your privacy and for the comfort of the other passengers.\n",
            "Avoid getting involved further if a passenger breaches etiquette by doing something like constantly thumping or yanking your seat back, and refusing your polite request not to do so.\n",
            "Instead, ask a flight attendant to handle the situation, and if they can't or even won't (this does happen), ask politely but insistently for the chief flight attendant (purser) to handle it.\n",
            "Avoid grabbing the back of the seat in front of you.\n",
            "Grabbing the seat back as you walk in the aisle or your row can be unpleasantly jarring to the person sitting in it. Copy the flight attendants who balance themselves in the aisle by grabbing the luggage compartments above their heads, rather than the seat backs.\n",
            "Respect others' willingness to talk.\n",
            "No matter how much you love to make new friends on the plane, the person next to you might rather get some work done, or simply may not feel like being chatty. If a friendly comment gets a minimal answer, take the hint and leave them be. If you're traveling with children, avoid letting them think of passengers as playmates. Some passengers will smile to be polite, but may not be interested in playing \"peek a boo\" with the child.\n",
            "Keep in mind your screen is visible to those behind you if you want to watch a movie on your DVD player.\n",
            "If your movie has nudity, graphic violence, etc. it may offend the more sensitive viewers (e.g. children) looking on. Using a smaller, handheld device to view movies, such as an iPod Touch, may be more practical in this situation.\n",
            "Watch your elbows.\n",
            "If you're reading a newspaper or using a laptop, try not to let your elbows \"spill over\" onto someone else's personal space. Do your best not to hog the armrests, especially if the person next to you is in the middle and has limited space, to begin with.Use your armrest and head/earphone plug outlet. Don't use someone else's because it's more convenient for you.\n",

            "Do not start or join phone calls or group meetings.\n",
            "This includes voice-over-IP services like Skype and group call services like Discord. Phone conversations, especially on Wi-Fi, can be a nuisance to other passengers; as such, many airlines and the FCC do not support the use of airplane Wi-Fi for phone calls. Keep those for a while you are on the ground in your hotel room.\n",
            "Be considerate of other passengers when you exit the plane.\n",

            "to clean up any loose dirt and debris. Use a soft broom to sweep up all the loose dirt and debris from the marble floor into a pile. Sweep the pile into a dust pan and pour it out into a garbage can.[1]Pay special attention to any corners or spaces underneath furniture where dust and dirt can accumulate. Lift up any rugs or mats and remove them temporarily so you can access the floor underneath them.\n",
            "Mop the floor to remove stuck-on grime.\n",
            "Pass a damp mop over the entire marble floor using figure-eight motions to clean up any dirt that you werent able to sweep up. Rinse the mop in a bucket of clean water and wring it out when it becomes dirty or dries up as you work.[2]If the floor is particularly dirty and the mop water becomes dirty when you rinse out the mop, pour out the bucket and refill it with fresh water to avoid reapplying dirt to the floor as you mop.\n",
            "Apply a homemade poultice to stains to treat them before polishing.\n",
            "Mix 1 part hydrogen peroxide with 4 parts water and enough baking soda to make it into a thick paste. Cover any stains completely with the paste, then cover the paste with plastic wrap and tape the edges down. Let it sit for 24-48 hours until it is completely dry, then remove it and wipe the area clean with a damp cloth and dry it off with a clean towel.[3]The poultice paste will suck out stains from the porous marble. If the stain is still visible after the treatment, repeat the process with another application of poultice.\n",
            "Mix a tiny bit of mild liquid dish detergent into a bucket of water.\n",
            "Use an environmentally-friendly liquid dish detergent and a bucket of clean water. Squeeze 3-4 drops of the detergent into the bucket and agitate it until it starts to foam up.[4]A solution of mild soap and water is all you need to polish marble floors by hand. Marble is very porous and delicate, so harsh chemical cleaners can damage it and dull its finish.\n",
            "Soak a sponge in the bucket of soapy water and wring out the excess water.\n",
            "Dip a clean sponge into the bucket to saturate it completely. Lift it out and wring it out over the bucket until it is just damp and not dripping with soapy water.[5]A regular yellow sponge is all you need to apply the solution to the marble floor. You just need to use the soft spongy part, so it doesnt matter whether it has a green abrasive side or not.\n",
            "Sponge the floor using small circular motions.\n",
            "Work in small sections and apply light pressure as you move the sponge in small circular or arcing motions. Rewet the sponge as needed while you work until you have sponged the whole floor with the soap solution.[6]If there are any stubborn stains that you cant get out with the sponge, you can use a soft-bristled brush to scrub them more vigorously.\n",
            "Rinse the floor with clean, warm water from another bucket.\n",
            "Fill a bucket with clean warm water. Work in small sections and carefully pour out just enough to rinse away any soap residue.[7]Dont ever let puddles of water sit on marble floors for extended periods of time.\n",
            "Wipe the floor dry with soft dry towels using circular motions.\n",
            "Use a soft, clean towel, such as a microfiber cloth or chamois. Wipe up the water from the rinsed areas using circular motions.[8]This will clean up any remaining soap residue and polish the marble surface.\n",
            "Buff out any scratches with a marble polishing powder.\n",
            "Sprinkle a small amount of marble polishing powder on top of any spots with scratches or scuffs.[9] Rub the powder into the scratches with a clean damp cloth using circular motions. Wipe the marble clean with another clean damp cloth, then dry it with a fresh cloth.[10]Make sure you use a polishing powder that specifically states it is OK to use on marble. Always refer to the product's instructions for any additional suggestions to achieve the best results.\n",
            "Wipe up spills immediately to prevent damage and permanent staining.\n",
            "Many types of liquids can leave permanent stains on marble floors. Act quickly whenever you spill something on the floor to wipe it up with a nonabrasive sponge or soft cloth.[11]Even plain water can dull the surface of the floor if you leave it sitting. Acidic liquids like vinegar, citrus, or wine will especially damage marble if you dont wipe them up right away.Avoid using all-purpose cleaners and homemade acidic cleaning solutions, such as those that contain lemon juice or vinegar. These types of cleaners will damage the finish of the marble and leave it looking dull.Its OK to use a commercial cleaner that is specifically made for cleaning marble surfaces.\n",
            "Avoid vacuuming a marble floor to keep from scratching it.\n",
            "A vacuum cleaner has lots of hard parts on the bottom that can scratch the soft surface of marble. Use only a soft broom and mop to perform regular cleaning.[12]A soft dust broom and a sponge mop are ideal for safely cleaning your marble floors without scratching them.\n",
            "Place mats or rugs in high-traffic areas to protect the floor.\n",
            "Put down welcome mats by doors to the outside that people come in and out of to keep some of the outdoor dirt and grime from getting tracked over the floors. Place rugs in areas where people constantly pass by, such as hallways or living areas, to help protect the surfaces from scratches.[13]Its very easy to damage the polished shine of a marble floor with abrasive dirt, so the more you protect it, the longer it will last and the less polishing it will require.\n",
            "Put felt pads on the bottom of any furniture that is on top of the marble floor.\n",
            "Apply stick-on felt pads to the bottoms of the legs of any furniture like chairs or tables. This will protect the floor from scratches when you slide the furniture around.[14]You can get stick-on felt pads at a home improvement store or online. Buy a big pad that you can cut to different sizes if you have a lot of different furniture you want to apply it to.\n",
            "Reseal the floor every 3-6 years to protect its shine.\n",
            "Apply a new coat of marble sealer to the entire surface of the floor with a clean, soft rag. This will penetrate the pores of the marble to seal them and protect the floor from spills and stains.[15]You can check if it is time to reseal the floor by pouring a spoonful of water onto an inconspicuous spot of the surface. If the water gets absorbed and darkens the stone in 1 minute or less, there is no sealer left on the marble and you need to apply a new coat.\n",

            "Make your pie using cold ingredients.\n",
            "Preparing your pie with cold ingredients and then putting the chilled pie into a hot oven will help prevent mushiness. Everything should be cold, including your ingredients, bowls, and materials. You can chill your pie in the refrigerator, as well.To chill your pie in the refrigerator, place the assembled pie inside the refrigerator for about fifteen minutes.Preheat your oven to the baking temperature.Put the cold pie into the hot oven.[1]\n",
            "Choose tart apples.\n",
            "When you cook apples, the pectin in them breaks down, making the apples watery. The lower pH value of tart apples reduces the amount of pectin that breaks down, so the apples hold their shape and get less mushy. This will prevent your pie from getting watery.Your best apple choices are Granny Smith, Gala, and Golden Delicious.[2]Use firm apples and avoid overripe fruit.[3]\n",
            "Add a thin sprinkling of flour on top of your bottom crust.\n",
            "A light layer of flour will soak up excess liquid in your filling without changing the flavor of your pie. Sprinkle the flour over the pie crust before you add your pie filling.You can also use ground nuts, though you might be able to taste them in the pie.[4]\n",
            "Cut vents into your crust.\n",
            "You need to cut five -inch (2 centimeter) vents in your top pie crust to allow the evaporating liquid to escape. This will prevent the pie from becoming soggy.Vents are usually placed near the center of the pie. Many people enjoy making five vents in a star pattern like the seeds inside an apple.Your vents will also help you tell if the pie is ready. The pie filling will start to bubble up out of the vents when it is nearly done.A lattice style pie does not need vents as long as there are gaps in the lattice.You also do not need to cut vents into a Dutch apple pie, which will be topped with a crumbly topping.\n",
            "Allow your pie to bake for the entire recommended period.\n",
            "Your pie may start to brown early, making it look ready. People often pull their pie too soon out of fear that it will burn. This leads to runny pie because it prevents the filling from thickening.Check the recommended cooking time, and set a timer.Dont use the brownness of your pie crust to judge if it is done.[5]\n",
            "Use aluminum foil to prevent over-browning the crust.\n",
            "If you're worried your crust will over-brown, cover the crust with foil halfway through baking. To do this, measure your foil before you put the pie in the oven. Pull off a piece big enough to cover the whole pie, then cut out the center so that only the crust will be covered. Halfway through your baking time, carefully place the foil onto the pie, covering the crust.You can also place strips of foil around the edge of the pie crust, but it's safer to use one big piece since you could burn yourself on the hot pie.[6]If your oven has a tendency to cook pies unevenly, then you may want to apply foil strips to just the part of the crust that is already brown, leaving the rest to continue browning.\n",
            "Place your fruit in sugar.\n",
            "Add your sliced apples into a bowl and add the amount of sugar your recipe calls for. The sugar will draw out the excess liquid from the fruit.[7]Try tossing the apples in cinnamon too to help absorb some of the moisture.\n",
            "Allow your apples to soak at least 30 minutes.\n",
            "Set aside the bowl for a half an hour. During this time, you can prepare the crust if youd like.[8]\n",
            "Drain away the natural juices.\n",
            "Use a colander to strain all of the liquid from the bowl. You can use this liquid in another recipe if youd like, or you can try to thicken it by cooking it on the stove.If you decide to thicken it, heat it over low heat until the extra moisture evaporates, leaving a thicker sauce. You can add this sauce to your pie if youd like, though you may want to add a thickener if you do. Cook the sauce until it reaches your desired consistency or it reaches the thickness of syrup.[9]\n",
            "Add the apples to your pie.\n",
            "When you are ready to insert your pie filling, place the apples into the pie crust. Continue with the rest of your recipe.[10]If you plan to use the sauce you made using the natural juices as filling, add that to the pie as well.\n",
            "Bulk up your apple mixture with thickener.\n",
            "A thickener prevents the filling from being too watery by adding a substance that will absorb some of the liquid that seeps out of the fruit. A small amount of thickener should not alter the flavor of your pie.\n",
            "Use cornstarch as a thickener.\n",
            "Cornstarch is smooth and doesnt alter the flavor, though it can make your fruit mixture look opaque.\n",
            "Try flour as a thickener.\n",
            "Flour is convenient because you should already have some on hand. It shouldnt alter the flavor, and usually works well for apple pie.\n",
            "Choose quick-cooking tapioca as a thickener.\n",
            "Quick-cooking tapioca is best for soaking up extra liquid, and it doesnt make your filling look cloudy. It does require at least ten minutes of cooking at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) in order for it to fully thicken the mixture.[11]\n",
            "Add one tbsp (15 ml) of thickener per pound (.45 kg) of apples.\n",
            "Stir the thickener into your apple mixture before pouring it into the crust. The thickener should be well-blended into the mixture.[12]Expect cornstarch and flour to make your pie filling a bit cloudy. This is normal.\n",
            "Pour boiling water over the apples, then let them sit 10 minutes.\n",
            "Boil enough water to cover your apples. Place the sliced apples in a heat-safe bowl. Pour the water over the apples, then cover the bowl. Let them sit for ten minutes. Drain the apples, then continue with your recipe.You can also use apple cider for a cider-flavored pie filling.[13]\n",
            "Nuke your apples in the microwave.\n",
            "Place your sliced apples in a microwave safe container. Nuke the apples for three minutes, then stir and measure the temperature. Continue to heat and stir at three-minute intervals until your apples reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius). Allow the apples to rest for ten minutes, turning on the microwave for five seconds every three to four minutes to keep the apples at the right temperature.[14]\n",
            "Heat the apples on your stove.\n",
            "Place your sliced apples in a skillet. Heat the skillet on medium-high heat, constantly stirring the apples. You should stir the apples for the entire time you are heating them. Heat the apples for ten minutes.[15]This is the hardest way to pre-cook the apples since you must stir the entire time.\n",

            "Sharpen your colored pencils before using them for the best color.\n",
            "A sharp colored pencil will allow you to make finer lines as well as more vibrant colors. Sharpen all of your colored pencils using a pencil sharpener each time you go to use them, creating a fine point.[1]\n",
            "Use controlled, slow movements to create the best drawing.\n",
            "Instead of rushing through your drawing and quickly applying the color, slow down and make your lines more precise. When you color quickly, youre more likely to press too hard and create messy lines.[2] Professional artist Rebecca Schweiger suggests \"varying the pressure of each pencil, so you can see how light and dark you can get your colors.\"Holding your pencil at an angle helps to control your arm movements and slow down a bit.\n",
            "Hold your pencil on its side to shade a larger area in lighter shades.\n",
            "By using your colored pencils side, the color will be slightly lighter and the strokes will be broader. This is helpful for layering or if youre trying to cover a large area in a faster amount of time. The lighter you press on the paper with the colored pencil, the lighter the color youll create.[3][4]Holding your pencil farther back, as opposed to right next to the tip, will help you keep your shading light because you wont be applying as much pressure.\n",
            "Use the tip of your pencil and apply pressure for darker shades.\n",
            "The tip of your colored pencil is great for making precise, skinny lines. If youre using the tip and pressing down, know that your color is going to come out more concentrated, so youll want to be very sure about your marks before you make them.[5]Use the tip of your colored pencil to create fine details or outline parts of drawings.Keep sharpening your pencil when it becomes dull so the tip remains sharp.\n",
            "Layer your color slowly as opposed to immediately applying pressure.\n",
            "According to professional artist Rebecca Schweiger, \"Layering is the best way to properly blend colored pencils.\" Even if youre only using one color, apply a layer of light color by holding your pencil softly, and then keep adding light layers on top of that one until you reach your desired shade.[6] Schweiger advises \"applying a little extra pressure to the color that you want to shine through more.\" If you were drawing a red apple, Schweiger suggests \"layering some blue on top to create colored shadows.\"Avoid immediately using pressure to create bright colors. This makes it very hard to add other colors on top of it, and it makes your shading look uneven.Really allow yourself to mix the colors so that you can see how light and how dark you can get your colors!\n",
            "Blot the color away with an eraser to lighten the pencil marks.\n",
            "Instead of rubbing the eraser on the colored pencil marks to try to remove the color, try lightly blotting at the marks with an eraser instead. If you rub your paper with the eraser, its just going smear the color and ruin your picture.[7]While it's unlikely that you'll completely erase the colored pencil marks, blotting at them with an eraser may lighten them significantly.Try purchasing colored pencils that are specifically designed to erase and come with their own special erasers if desired.\n",
            "Color using back-and-forth strokes.\n",
            "This is the most common way to use colored pencils, and you probably do it naturally when shading. Color in your drawing using a back-and-forth motion while not lifting your pencil from the paper.[8]This is a good way to fill in areas with color very quickly.\n",
            "Draw using circular marks to create texture.\n",
            "Instead of using continuous lines going back and forth, create circles instead. Put your colored pencil to the paper and start creating small, light circles going on top of one another without lifting your pencil from the paper. The more circular marks you layer on top of one another, the more vibrant the color youll create.[9]Another name for this method is scumbling.Use this method to color in a flower or large object that's all the same color.\n",
            "Create hatch marks for a uniform color drawing.\n",
            "Hatching is when you draw small parallel lines next to one another all going in the same direction. Create your hatch marks as close or far apart from one another as youd like. The closer together you make your marks, the more colorful your drawing will seem.[10]You might use hatch marks to show the shading and shadows of a hand or a pillow.\n",
            "Try crosshatching to form vibrant tones in your drawing.\n",
            "To crosshatch, create hatch marks by forming parallel lines next to one another, and then create another set of parallel lines going the opposite way. This creates a bunch of X marks right beside one another. This is a great way to shade in your drawing to give it a uniform look.[11]Crosshatching is useful if youre blending two colors togetheryou can use one color for one set of parallel lines, and the other color for the other set of parallel lines going the opposite direction.Use crosshatching to shade in a picture of a barn or a piece of fruit.\n",
            "Use the stippling technique to create texture using dots.\n",
            "Stippling is when you use your colored pencil to make dots all over the paper. The dots can be close together or far apart, but the closer together and the more there are, the more colorful and vibrant your drawing will be.[12]Stippling adds great texture to your drawing.Make the dots as thin or thick as youd like, experimenting with different versions until you find one you like the best.You could use the stippling technique to draw a seashell or a wave in the ocean.\n",
            "Shade using burnishing for a very smooth look.\n",
            "Burnishing is adding layer after layer of color on top of one another until theres so much colored pencil that it creates a glazed, smooth surface. As you keep adding layers, youll need to press harder for the colored pencil to show up, which is what creates the shiny quality.[13]Burnishing can take a long time due to the number of layers youll need to add on top of one another to create a smooth look.Try drawing the sunset or a vegetable using the burnishing method.Blend your coloring using a blender or paper stump to make the process go faster. You can also use your fingertips to blend the colors.[14]\n",

            "Choose the correct diameter of lead.\n",
            "Different mechanical pencils require lead of a certain thickness. You can usually find this measurement written either on your mechanical pencil itself or its clip. Because of how thin this lead is, the diameter is typically expressed in millimeters as a decimal, like 0.5 mm, as an example.0.3 mm diameter is considered to be relatively thin. This size of lead might not be suitable for writing or sketching, but using it you'll be able to draw with very minute detail.0.5 mm thick lead is used to be one of the most common sizes of lead. You might use 0.5mm lead for writing or drawing. Overall, it's still a versatile size that might be just right for your writing needs.0.7 mm lead is a thicker variety, which makes it suited to sketching and non-detailed work. You may also find this lead useful if you do long-hand drafting. It it also more common nowadays compared to 0.5mm, as cheaper mechanical pencils became more popular using 0.7mm.0.9 mm lead is an even thicker lead. It can be used with a rather soft lead, and therefore will have less breakage.  Good for puzzles on newsprint (crossword, sudoku).\n",
            "Use specialty sizes for specific purposes.\n",
            "Outside of .3, .5, and .7 mm lead, there are thicker and thinner sizes available for your mechanical pencil. These range from size .3 mm all the way to 5.6 mm, though sizes above .9 mm may require a specialty mechanical pencil to write with. These ultra-fine and extra thick leads are frequently intended for artists or draftsmen, though you may find that a specialty size suits your purposes as well.[2]Some specialty leads, like sizes 2 mm and up, require sharpening, unlike most other kinds of mechanical pencil lead. You should follow the directions that come on the packaging of your lead to learn the best process for sharpening.[3]\n",
            "Determine the best hardness for your work.\n",
            "Soft lead will leave behind a thicker mark when you write. It is darker and more smudge prone than other leads. Harder leads leave behind marks that are lighter and finer. The two most common hardness ratings are medium grade HB and H leads, but there are three main categories of hardness that you should take into consideration:[4]Soft lead. The softness of this lead is represented by a number followed by the letter B. The higher the number, the softer the lead. Therefore, 4B lead will be very soft, 3B lead less so, and so on.Medium lead. With medium leads, the letter B represents the softest kind and will write like a No. 1 pencil. HB medium leads write the same as a No. 2 pencil. F medium leads are similar to a No. 2 pencil. Last but not least, H medium leads will be hardest and correspond to a No. 3 pencil.Hard lead. The hardness rating for hard lead is indicated by a number followed by an H. As the numbers increase, so too will the hardness of your lead. An 2H pencil (corresponding to No. 4) will be softer than a 3H pencil, and so on.\n",
            "Consider your writing style.\n",
            "If you are aware that you have a tendency to use hard or soft pressure when writing, you should take this into account when choosing your lead hardness and thickness. The pressure you use when writing can have a distinct affect on the marks you leave on the page.Heavy handed writers may find fine points break easily when writing, while soft leads leave behind thick, clumsy looking lines. If you're one such person, you may want to stick with medium thickness leads of medium hardness or harder.Light handed writers may have difficulty with harder leads. You may find, if you have a lighter touch, that hard leads force you to press with your pencil harder than is comfortable.\n",
            "Choose the appropriate lead sleeve for your pencil.\n",
            "The sleeve of your mechanical pencil is the part that extends from the pen cylinder and ends where your lead emerges. There are three main varieties of sleeve for you to choose from: fixed sleeves, sliding sleeves, and sleeveless.A sleeve will give you a better view of your drawing/writing area, making this feature an asset if you do detail work in pencil. However, you should be careful when pocketing a fixed sleeve pencil; the points of these could easily jab you in the leg.Sliding sleeve pencils are able to retract within the body of your pencil. If you enjoy writing with a sleeved pencil but don't like getting poked when it's in your pocket, this option may be right for you.[5]\n",
            "Prioritize .5/.7 mm pencils for easier lead replacement.\n",
            "Even if you prefer a thicker or thinner diameter lead pencil, you may want to have a .5/.7 mm on hand as well. These are the most common sizes of mechanical pencil, meaning that if you run out of lead and are in a pinch, you'll have an easier time finding or purchasing replacement lead.When using a less common sized mechanical pencil, you may want to carry replacement lead with you. This way, you won't have to scrounge for specialty lead if you run out.\n",
            "Discover your preferred lead advance mechanism.\n",
            "A lead advance is the way in which your mechanical pencil advances lead from the hollow chamber in its barrel to the tip of the pencil. The lead advance of your pencil will be activated by a button, twist, or shake mechanism.Push button lead advances come in a two different types. Some have a button on the side of the pencil, others use a top button that combines with the eraser. In either case, you can advance your lead by pressing the button.Twist-operated lead advances were more common in older models. By twisting the barrel of your mechanical pencil, you'll cause the lead to advance. Some models may have a continuous lead advance, where the more you twist, the more lead is advanced.A shake advance can be activated by giving your mechanical a firm shake up and down. This motion will cause a small weight on the inside of the pencil to advance the lead.\n",
            "Use a pencil with a lead grade/size indicator for organization.\n",
            "There are some models of pencils that allow you to set an indicator to show you the grade (hardness) of the lead in your pencil. If you switch between grades when working on different projects, a grade indicator can help save you from using a pencil loaded with the wrong lead! A lead size indicator can also save you from using the wrong size of lead\n",
            "Find a pencil grip that suits your hand.\n",
            "Most mechanical pencils come with a padded, soft, rubber-like grip on the part your hand holds. Different pencil grips will suit different hands, and some grips have special features, like bumpy textures to help you hold onto your pencil. Take a test write with potential candidates before you make the purchase to find what feels right to you.Some pens come with a triangular shaped grip. This may feel strange to you at first, but some users appreciate the additional contact this kind of grip gives with the pencil.\n",

            "Select a topic.\n",
            "Ideally, the topic of discussion should be important to enough people that you can involve people with significantly different interests or backgrounds. However, avoid the trap of making a topic so general or vague that the discussion becomes unfocused.If you are having difficulty balancing these goals, remember the topic does not need to be divisive. Some panels are created to offer advice or information, and these do not always have competing points of view on display.\n",
            "Recruit varied participants.\n",
            "A panel of three to five people usually creates the most interesting discussion. Look for well-informed people from a variety of backgrounds. For instance, a member of the public involved in the issue, someone with experience working with the issue in a business or nonprofit, and an academic who has studied the issue. Create a panel with variation in age, gender, and ethnicity as well, as a person's personal background can have a significant effect on his perspective.Inviting at least four people may be safest, in case someone cancels at the last minute.Invite these people several weeks in advance at a minimum, to allow them adequate time to prepare, and to give yourself time to find alternatives if one of them turns the offer down.\n",
            "Invite a moderator.\n",
            "Select an additional person not participating in the panel discussion, to serve as a moderator. Ideally, she should already have experience moderating panels. Select someone who understands the topic well enough to follow the discussion, and who is skilled in social situations. The moderator's main purpose is to keep the panelists focused on the audience, keep the discussion running smoothly, and help out the panelists when they stall.[1]\n",
            "Plan the physical setup.\n",
            "Individual chairs will make the participants appear closer to the audience than a solid table, encouraging audience participation.[2] Arranging the seats in a slight circle, still mostly facing the audience, may help the panelists discuss the topic with each other. Include small tables or stands for holding notes, and provide a glass of water for each participant. Unless the room seats thirty people or fewer, provide at least one microphone for each two participants, and a personal microphone for the moderator.Consider seating the moderator in the middle of the panelists to help him address and guide each panelist efficiently. Keeping the moderator at a podium off to one side may make his job more difficult.\n",
            "Figure out the goals of the panel.\n",
            "Make sure all of the participants know why the panel has been assembled well in advance, so they have time to prepare. Your panel may be trying to present practical solutions to a problem, host a complex, abstract discussion, or provide information on a topic. Let the panelists know whether the panel is a basic introduction to the topic, or whether they can expect the audience to be fairly well-informed and looking for more advanced advice or nuanced perspectives.\n",
            "Decide how long the panel should last.\n",
            "For most panels, especially those taking place at a conference or other larger event, 4560 minutes is the recommended length of time.[3] If the panel is a standalone event, or if it covers a particularly important and popular topic, a 90 minute panel may be appropriate.If possible, ask participants to stick around for some time after the session, so audience members can talk in person.\n",
            "Consider starting with individual lectures (optional).\n",
            "The main focus of the panel should always be a discussion. However, if one of the panel's main goals is providing information, this may be a useful way to precede the discussion.Have each panelist provide an explanation of the topic, or her argument concerning the topic, lasting no more than ten minutes per person.This method may require more preparation time for the panelists as a group, as each panelist should build off the previous argument, rather than cover the same ground.\n",
            "Try to avoid visual presentations.\n",
            "Unless absolutely necessary for the topic, avoid PowerPoint presentations and slides. They tend to slow down the discussion, keep audience involvement low, and often bore the listeners. Use a small number of slides, and only when information or diagrams need to be presented that cannot easily be explained in words alone.If a panelist asks for permission to create a presentation, suggest he bring in \"show and tell\" items instead to pass around the audience during discussion.\n",
            "Write questions for the panelists.\n",
            "Try to come up with several open-ended questions, which the panelists can take in a direction best suited to the course of the discussion and their expertise.[4] A few more specific questions directed at an individual panelist are also acceptable, but try to divide these among the panelists fairly evenly. Anticipate questions audience members might ask, and include these as well. Arrange these in rough order of most to least importance, as you should provide more questions than you expect to get through. Try to keep each question tied into the last however, avoiding a sudden change of topic.Have the moderator or another person not on the panel look over your questions and suggest edits or additional questions.If you are having trouble coming up with questions, ask each panelist individually what he would like to ask the other panelists. Include the best of these questions in your list.\n",
            "Plan out the rest of the panel.\n",
            "Determine how much time you will set aside for questions; typically, this constitutes half the panel's length or more. Use the last 2030 minutes for audience questions and discussion, or 15 minutes if time is short or you have a more lecture-focused panel format.[5]\n",
            "Introduce the panelists to each other in advance.\n",
            "Have the panelists meet in person or attend a conference call together, a week or more in advance of the panel. Describe the format of the panel to them, and give them a chance to talk briefly. They may briefly determine who should field questions on which topic, but don't give them the specific questions in advance. The discussion should be original, not rehearsed.[6]\n",
            "Convince people to sit in the front row.\n",
            "The closer the panel is to the audience member, the more energetic and involved the atmosphere will feel. Consider offering small \"freebies\" if people move to the front rows, such as buttons or candy.[7]\n",
            "Briefly introduce the panel and each participant.\n",
            "Use only one or two sentences to introduce the panel topic, since most audience members present are likely familiar with the basic idea. Introduce each participant briefly, mentioning only a couple relevant facts about her experience or involvement related to the topic. Avoid going into a complete biography; the introduction of all participants should take no more than ten minutes total.\n",
            "Involve the audience early.\n",
            "Get the audience invested in the panel by asking for their involvement right away. A simple, quick way to do this is to begin by asking for a rough poll of their opinion related to the topic, using a show of hands or applause.[8] Alternatively, poll the audience on their level of knowledge of the topic. The results should help you keep the panel focused on topics most relevant to the audience.\n",
            "Ask the panelists the prepared questions.\n",
            "Start going through the questions in the prearranged order, but don't hesitate to adjust this order if the discussion moved in a different, interesting direction. Divide questions among the participants, aiming them at the person most knowledgeable on the topic. Give other panelists a short amount of time to respond, then move on to the next question.Don't have every panelist weigh in on every question. Let the panelists respond naturally, when they have something to say, or prompt someone who is knowledgeable on the topic if the discussion is faltering.\n",
            "Follow through with your own questions as necessary.\n",
            "You may deviate from the prepared questions whenever you think it will benefit from the discussion. In particular, press a panelist with a followup question if you think his answer is unsatisfying. Try rephrasing the original question, or ideally, come up with a more nuanced question that ties the last response to another discussion point or a previous statement.\n",
            "Get a timekeeper.\n",
            "You may look at an actual clock offstage or on the opposite wall, if one is clearly visible. Otherwise, have someone stand at the back of the room with visible signs saying \"10 min,\" \"5 min,\" and \"1 min\", holding these up as appropriate when you are nearing the end of a section.\n",
            "Keep the panelists on task.\n",
            "When a panelist is going on too long, or going off topic, politely return the discussion to the correct point. When she pauses for breath, jump in with a phrase similar to one of the following. You may choose to let panelists know beforehand what phrases you'll be using to bring them back on track.\"You have an interesting point, but let's hear more about ___\"\"Let's see what (other panelist) has to say on that topic, especially how it relates to __.\"\n",
            "Collect questions from the audience.\n",
            "Let the audience know how you plan to recruit question, for instance by calling on raised hands or inviting them to wait in line at a microphone. Listen to each question in turn, repeat it clearly so everyone in the room can hear, then refer it to a panelist who appears interested.Have a couple backup questions ready to ask yourself, or have an assistant in the audience ask, in case no one is brave enough to ask first question.[9]If an audience member is taking up too much time, politely interrupt to say \"So your question is ___, is that right?\" or \"I'm sorry, we need to keep things moving. What is your question?\"Let people know when you only have enough time for two or three more questions.\n",
            "Thank everyone involved.\n",

            "This is the time to set reasonable and achievable goals. Choose a competition at which youll excel, and make sure its far enough in the future that you have plenty of time to train effectively. Do some research into the judges and organizers as well to see what they look for in a winning competitor.\n",
            "Dont psych yourself out.\n",
            "Plenty of people get scared off by a competitions requirements and dont enter in the first place. Others drop out along the way. Since youve done your research, you can be confident in your choice to compete and your potential to win. So, stand strong even when you have your doubts and when others may be dropping out.\n",
            "Learn your competition.\n",
            "Remember that youre not competing with everyone in the competition. There may be many applicants and candidates, but there will only be a few contenders and finalists.[1] Focus on understanding and beating them.Determine who among your competition is strongest. This way, you can have an idea of who might be your most likely competition. First, youll need to figure out who is likely to enter your competition. Look at past lists of competitors, and focus on the winners or those who placed in the top 10. You might also talk to fans, coaches, or writers who are knowledgeable about your sport or other competition.Review competitors past performances. If possible, try to watch videos or read articles about your rivals previous competitions. Look for strengths and weaknesses. Also observe overall strategy, bearing in mind how your own strategy might match up.\n",
            "Enter the competition.\n",
            "You can't be in a competition if you don't enter. Apply carefully and review your application to ensure there arent any mistakes.Pay any necessary entry fees. If the competition has an entry fee, pay it early, if possible, but definitely on time. Sometimes, early entry is cheaper or free as well, which is a plus. Also, remember to get a receipt.Enter early. This is particularly true if the competition involves judges reviewing some work product. In a short-story writing contest, for example, the bulk of entries tend to come toward the end of the submission period.[2] Entering early allows you to have more of the undivided attention of the judges, while entering later might mean your submission is lost in the pile with everyone elses.\n",
            "Learn the rules.\n",
            "You dont want any surprises on competition day. Learning the rules inside and out will help you excel on game day, and it will give you peace of mind and possibly even an edge over less prepared competitors. Understanding the rules will also help reduce the chances that you will be disqualified for breaking them.\n",
            "Consult an expert.\n",
            "Finding an expert or coach in your area of competition can help aim you toward winning. Look for past competitors, retired players, or reporters or authors who have written on the subject. Having a coach is ideal as well, as he can provide you with not just training tips but motivation and encouragement as well.\n",
            "Get the right equipment.\n",
            "Proper equipment that works for you specifically is crucial, particularly when styles or types of equipment and clothing vary considerably.Wear appropriate clothing. Your clothes should fit properly and comfortably. They should also conform to the expected weather. For many sports, youll want clothing that breathes well so that you dont overheat. Other types of gear may need to be customized to your sport. Cyclists often wear aerodynamic clothing and helmets, for example.Use proper gear. Gear that works well for you can make a huge difference in your performance. Goggles that fit your face and dont allow water to come in, especially after diving into the pool, are crucial for swimmers. Tennis players, as another example, need to consider grip, string tightness and alignment, size, shape, and weight of their racquets.Make sure all your equipment conforms to the rules. Revisit the rules of the competition. Many competitions specifically set out parameters for what types of equipment are and are not allowed. If youre unsure of anything, ask.\n",
            "Develop a training schedule.\n",
            "Having a specific training schedule will take much of the stress out of training. With the exception of the occasional day off, try to train daily to improve over the course of your preparation time. Training daily will also help keep your competition top-of-mind as you prepare mentally.\n",
            "Train early, regularly, and with focus.\n",
            "Some competitions, such as boxing, require this time for recovery or making weight. Theres a built-in recovery or training time here, but with other competitions youll have to self-monitor to make sure youre getting early, frequent, and adequate training.Start training well ahead of the competitionseveral months ahead, if possible. Use this time to train, practice, and hone your skills. If your competition is coming up soon, be prepared to speed up your training session, and focus more on the fundamentals if you dont have time to cover everything youd like. Distance runners should focus on longer runs, for example, even if they'd ideally incorporate strength training and sprints as well.If possible, train for a set amount of time nearly every day. Just dont burn out physically or mentally during the training process.  Instead, train enough to be as prepared as possible and to be mentally comfortable with your level of preparation going into the competition.\n",
            "Vary your training styles.\n",
            "If youre on a four-person high school debate team, for example, you might want to practice by doing Lincoln-Douglas (i.e. one-on-one) debating to see what new skills or strategies you pick up from that. If youre on a certain side of the issue, you might practice debating the other side to understand your opponents potential strategies. Varying style in physical training also helps work different muscle groups, which is why a butterfly swimmer might try training in backstroke.\n",
            "Stick to your training.\n",
            "However you ultimately decide to train, its obviously important to stick to your regimen and remain persistent. Maintaining motivating can be challenging, but there are techniques you can use other than sheer will power.Set small goals within your training. For example, many cyclists who try to set hour records on the track (the distance you can ride in one hour) try training at their goal pace for five minutes at a time.  Then, they build to 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and so on.[3] The mini goals help keep you focused, while providing a sense of accomplishment along the way.Make a checklist. Everyone has different productivity styles. If it helps, consider making a training checklist, which might be particularly important if you dont have a coach to guide you. A checklist is what weightlifters do, for example, to keep track of the exercises theyve done, the number of reps, and the weight. With a written checklist, you also have one less thing to think and worry about.Give yourself encouraging reminders. Leave sticky notes on your mirror or car steering wheel. Write down anything motivational to keep you inspired. It doesnt have to be specific. It can simply be, You OWN the track today or 35.5 IS my time!Seek support from family and friends. Tell your close ones about your training, your obstacles, and your goals. They might have insights that can help you keep motivated. They might also serve as a welcome and healthy distraction to get you out of the bubble youre in while being so focused on training.\n",
            "Prepare mentally.\n",
            "You dont want to neglect this important part of training. In some ways, its the most important part because if youre not mentally sound, you wont have the presence of mind to focus on the competition. Among the biggest things you can do is choose to have a positive attitude and remain motivated.Avoid naysayers and any other discouraging influences.[4] Hopefully, you do this already in other aspects of your life, so why not during your training? Since youve already set reasonable goals, you dont need to worry about naysayers, and there will always be doubters and discouraging people no matter what goal you set. So, tune them out.Manage your anxiety and emotions during training and during the competition itself.[5] This takes practice. Sometimes you dont know how you will feel while running your first half-marathon. So, consider running some 5Ks or 10Ks, for example. You dont necessarily have to race for speed, but to understand how it feels to compete in your sport. This will also mitigate surprises on the day of your own competition in the half-marathon.Be fearless. Fear saps up your motivation. So, to stay motivated, replace fear with focus: focus on your goals, focus on your training, and focus on the moment. Your goals are what you want and now is all you can control; thats where you need your focus to be to overcome fear.\n",
            "Visualize victory.\n",
            "Golfers in particular do this by visualizing each hole and each shot on the course theyre about to play, but this applies to all competitions. Visualization helps you practice seeing the success youre trying to achieve by envisioning specifics. Effective visualization also improves your focus and concentration overall.\n",
            "Rest and eat up.\n",
            "In the days leading up to your competition, you want to be well rested and eat food that will give you the energy and concentration to perform well. Try to get eight hours of sleep in the days before a competition, and dont skip breakfast the morning of the big day.What you eat specifically varies depending on the competition, but youll generally want to raise your blood sugar with fruits and focus on carbohydrates to maximize your energy.[6] Avoid overeating, and be sure to go to the bathroom before your competition begins.\n",
            "Check the weather.\n",
            "If your competition is outdoors, different weather conditions can definitely affect your strategy. If, for example, youre a sailor, youd want to know the weather to know which type of equipment to use, such as a different spinnaker. A wet course might require different shoes for a runner or different tires for a cyclist or off-roader.\n",
            "Arrive early.\n",
            "Arriving early offers plenty of benefits, in addition to the obvious one of not missing your competition. An early arrival also allows you to scout out the location of the event, as well as your competitors. You wont feel rushed or stressed either, as youll have plenty of time to prepare, suit up, and check your equipment, if necessary.\n",
            "Avoid distractions.\n",
            "Try not to chit-chat too much immediately before your competition. This can distract you from the competition in a bad way and harm your focus. Other competitors might try to engage you to intentionally try to distract you, which you dont want either.Find some space to yourself to clear your mind of everything except the task at hand. For example, you might find a corner to listen to music with your headphones. You might also take some extra time to yourself getting ready in the locker room, backstage, or parking lot, for example.\n",
            "Revisit your visualizations.\n",
            "Remember the visualizations you did as you prepared? Before the competition, do one last visualization of what youre about to do. See your competition through from beginning to end, focusing on each part and only each part as it comes. The competition should now your primary focus.\n",
            "Concentrate on execution.\n",
            "Now that its competition time, youre ready to perform what youve been practicing and execute your visualizations. Its time to focus entirely on the task at hand.Dont linger over mistakes during the competition. If, for example, you dont get the fastest start off the blocks in a track meet, avoid lingering on that by focusing on the next turn.Dont think about the outcome. Just as youre not dwelling on the past, try not to get distracted by the future either. Staying present is not necessarily easy, but it is important to staying focused on the competition and everything youve practiced.[7] If your mind wanders, dont worry about that either. Refocus and keep going.\n",
            "Give it your all.\n",
            "Remember, this is what youve been preparing for, and you have a plan. Follow the plan, give 110%, and stay focused. The rest will take care of itself.\n",

            "How to Style Jogger Pants: 10 Steps (with Pictures) - wikiHow\n",
            "Go casual with joggers made of knitted sweatpants material.\n",
            "If you want jogger pants for running errands and lounging, try a pair made of this traditional material. These joggers are very comfortable and feel almost like pajamas, but the tapered ankle and more fitted legs will make you look more pulled together.[1]Stick to lighter, airier pairs for warmer climates. A lightweight cotton or linen pair is perfect for this.If you need some extra insulation, check out fleece-lined jogger pants or versions in heavier fabrics like wool.\n",
            "Select a black pair made of nice material for a dressier look.\n",
            "Most jogger pants are worn casually, but you can dress them up, too. If you want to wear these to work or for dressier nights out, choose a pair of jogger pants made of a nice material and in a dark color.[2]Look for fabrics like tweed, corduroy, linen, and even leather to create a dressy look.[3]\n",
            "Experiment with different colors and patterns.\n",
            "You can basically find jogger pants in every color and pattern under the sun. A boldly patterned pair can make a fun statement, but they'll be less versatile than a solid color.[4] Try a solid statement color, like neon green!Think about how a pair will fit into your current wardrobe. Ideally, you can find a pair that will look great with tops and shoes you already own!\n",
            "Embrace the details.\n",
            "All jogger pants are not created equal. Simple pairs are great, but there are plenty of pairs with fun details and trendy features that will turn heads. Look for a pair with cool metallic zippers on the ankles, or a colorful drawstring around the waist.[5]For example, a solid pair with a different color or fabric cuff around the ankles creates a nice contrast.[6]\n",
            "Don't stick to athletic clothing.\n",
            "Jogger pants might seem like they must be paired with t-shirts, but that's not the case. Dress up your jogger pants with things like blazers, button-downs, and nice sweaters. The contrast between the more relaxed pants and a nicer, more sophisticated top is incredibly on-trend.[7]For example, you could pair a black pair of tweed joggers with a black blazer and look polished.\n",
            "Stick to tailored and fitted tops.\n",
            "The beauty of wearing jogger pants is that they are comfortable while still being acceptable to wear in public, but pairing them with slouchy, oversized tops can ruin that. To balance out the relaxed look of the jogger pants, it's best to pair them with tops that are more fitted.Whether it's a t-shirt, a nice blouse, or a button-down, opt for something that hugs your body a bit more.For example, go casual with a fitted green tank top and dark gray or black joggers.\n",
            "Tuck longer shirts in.\n",
            "Again, jogger shirts can go from trendy to sloppy easily. If your shirt covers the waistband of your pants, it's a good idea to tuck it in. If you're wearing a t-shirt, you can tuck it in super casually, letting the top still hang loosely. If you're dressing up your jogger pants with a nicer top, tuck it in properly. If you want to pull these pants off in public, it's important to look put-together.[8]If tucking looks strange, try tying up your shirt into a side knot. The key is keeping the waistband of the joggers exposed.\n",
            "Wear lace-up sneakers.\n",
            "If you're embracing the athleisure look, pick a pair of sneakers that have laces. Slip-on shoes are popular, but they will make your ensemble look a bit juvenile. Whether you're wearing a pair of every day casual sneakers or a high-tech pair of running shoes, a lace-up pair will work better with jogger pants.[9]For a sporty look, wear lace-up sneakers with a fitted hoodie and matching joggers.\n",
            "Dress up jogger pants with high heels or dress shoes.\n",
            "You may think your sky-high stilettos or patent leather dress shoes have no place with jogger pants, but they're actually perfect with them. A pair of jogger pants can be styled similarly to skinny jeans, so visualize outfits that way! From solid black to light-colored corduroy, a pair of dress shoes can completely formalize your outfit.[10]For example, you could create a dressy vibe by wearing a black cardigan with black fitted joggers, and finish off the look with patent leather pumps.\n",
            "Pair jogger pants with high-top sneakers or booties.\n",
            "You don't want your footwear to cover the elastic ankles, because you'll lose the shape of the jogger pants altogether. However, high-top sneakers, dress shoes, or short boots that come up to the tapered ankles are perfect. You can pull up your jogger pants a bit to ensure the hem sits on top of the shoe, rather than inside the shoe.\n",

            "Stay connected via texting, calling, or video chatting.\n",
            "One of the biggest challenges of long-distance relationships is the absence of physical contact with your partner. However, just because youre not side-by-side doesnt mean you cant form a real connection and keep the spark alive. Be sure to text, call, and video call each other as often as you need to help you feel connected to each other.This doesnt mean that you have to text or call them 24/7. In fact, avoid spamming them with messages since that may make them feel a bit suffocated. Just reach out to them when you feel like talking and let the conversation flow from there.Come up with a schedule to make sure youre contacting each other regularly. For example, save Friday evenings for FaceTiming each other.\n",
            "Help them get a better picture of your everyday life.\n",
            "Talking about the little, mundane happenings in your life can bring you and your partner closer, even if there are hundreds of miles between you. Tell them what you plan on eating for dinner, what you did during the day, or how youre planning to redecorate your home.[1]Telling your partner these boring details can actually give them a lot of insight into your life. Since they cant be there with you everyday, these little snapshots give them a better picture of who you are as a person.\n",
            "Dive into topics that will help you really understand your partner.\n",
            "Having a deep conversation is the perfect way to get to know the ins and outs of how your partner thinks and what they believe. These kinds of talks can also be an opportunity for you to express your honest thoughts and opinions on certain topics. You might discover plenty of things you have in common, or it could be an eye-opening experience that highlights your differences. Some topics to talk about include:Your goals and dreamsYour faithYour political viewsYour fears and worriesYour favorite memories\n",
            "Ask for their advice or opinions to include them in your world.\n",
            "To help strengthen your bond, do little things to make your partner feel like their presence is truly valued and appreciated in your life. Ask for their opinion when youre making a decision, go to them for advice about a problem, or even ask them for help on a project youre working on. Long-distance relationships work when you both truly feel involved in each others lives.For example, even if they cant be there to help, involve them in the conversation about what color you should paint your room.Or, ask them for honest advice if youre having trouble at work or school.Also be sure to introduce them to your friends and family since this can help them feel even closer to you and the important people in your life.\n",
            "Quality time helps to strengthen your emotional bond.\n",
            "Unfortunately, unlike in a regular relationship, you cant just hang out together or go to visit each other whenever you feel like it. However, that doesnt mean you cant carve out some special time to reconnect. When you spend quality time together, make sure all of your attention is on your partner and do some fun or relaxing things. For example:Have a dinner date over a video call.Put on the same movie at the same time and talk about it while you watch.Bake something together while video chatting.\n",
            "Connect over things you have in common to feel like you're together.\n",
            "Doing things together and sharing experiences, even while youre apart, can make you feel a lot closer to your partner. Itll give you something fun to talk about and can help create special memories. For example, read the same book and hop on a call to talk about it when youre done. Or, attempt to cook the same recipe and have a dinner date. It might help in making it feel like theyre really there beside you. Some other ideas include:Starting a new hobby together, like exercising, crafting, or painting.Learning a foreign language together.Going to restaurants with similar cuisines and giving reviews to each other.\n",
            "Shake things up with spicy texts, phone calls, or video calls.\n",
            "Even though youre pretty limited in your ability to get physical together, there are still plenty of ways you and your partner can be more intimate with each other. If youre feeling in the mood, send some dirty texts to your partner or give a go at having phone sex. Intimacy can help bring couples even closer together, and theres no reason you should miss out just because youre long-distance.Some other intimate things to do include taking a bath together over a video call and doing role-play with your partner.\n",
            "Plan times to physically be together to reaffirm your commitment.\n",
            "Being in a long-distance relationship doesnt necessarily mean you have to stay long-distance for the entire time. Make time to visit each other as often as possible or as often as your budget permits. Once you meet up, go ahead and do all the things you mightve been missing out on while communicating long-distance, such as going on dates or introducing each other to the place you live.Plan ahead for your next meetup so that you have something to look forward to.Meet away from home sometimes, too. Visit a place together thats new to both of you, or choose a place thats halfway between you and make a vacation out of it.\n",
            "Always be ready to give heartening words.\n",
            "Just because youre not right by each others sides doesnt mean you and your partner cant cheer each other on. Send them encouraging messages throughout the day, support them when they try new things, and offer them reassurance when they have doubts. Even though youre not together, youre still a team, and its important to remind them of that whenever you can.For example, if you know they have a big presentation at work coming up, send them a good luck message that day and let them know you want to hear all about how it went.Give them your full attention and listen attentively when they call you with a problem to show that you really care and want to help.\n",
            "Offer them words of affirmation every now and then.\n",
            "Complimenting your partner and expressing your gratitude to them can help remind them just how precious of a person they are to you. When youre in a long-distance relationship, its natural for you and your partner to have a few doubts about if things will work out at first. However, if you continuously remind them just how much they mean to you (and they do the same for you), your bond will definitely strengthen despite the distance.For example, make sure to tell your partner I love you often.Be direct and sincere with your compliments. For example, say something like, I really love how safe you make me feel or I love how in touch you are with your emotions.\n",
            "Surprise your love with small presents to show you're thinking of them.\n",
            "Just like how youd probably give gifts to your partner is a close-distance relationship, dont hesitate to shower your special someone with things they like during special occasions or just because. Fortunately, no amount of distance can stop you from sending a thoughtful gift through the mail. For example:[2]Send them chocolates on Valentines Day.Mail them a care package with all of their favorite snacks and treats.Gift them an item theyve always wanted for their birthday.Send them some flowers on a random day to let them know youre thinking of them.\n",
            "Swap out technology for romantic snail mail every now and then.\n",
            "Switch things up and write a hand-written love letter for your partner to send through the post. Technology makes communication almost instantaneous, but if youre looking to add a bit of excitement to your relationship, why not opt for a more traditional means of communicating? Not to mention, waiting for a reply will give you something to look forward to.[3]To make things more intimate, spritz your letter with your signature cologne or perfume so that your partner instantly thinks of you when they get it.Other things to send via the post include postcards, drawings, or even a calendar they can use to count down the days until you can meet up again.\n",
            "Make your relationship wants and needs clear to avoid conflict.\n",
            "Setting boundaries is a way to maintain a healthy balance between you and your partner and lays out your expectations for one another. These ground rules can act as a blueprint for your relationship and can be something you refer to if things get complicated. Discuss things youre comfortable and uncomfortable with regarding your relationship and set boundaries accordingly. For example:Let your partner know how often you want to call and text each other.Tell them if you feel uncomfortable sharing any personal details about your life.Set expectations that youll listen to each other without being judgmental.Specify how you want to approach your sexual needs. Do you want to stay monogamous, or open things up while you're apart?\n",
            "Being honest builds trust between you and your partner.\n",
            "All successful and healthy relationships, including long-distance ones, are rooted in good communication and honesty. If you and your partner both feel like you can be open and honest without the other person being too judgmental, the quality of your relationship is sure to improve.[4]For example, if somethings bothering you in your personal life, dont be afraid to open up to your partner and share whats going on.Or, if theres something thats been on your mind about your relationship, share your honest thoughts.Listen to your partner and avoid being too critical to show that they can trust you.\n",
            "Make your partner a priority, even during difficult patches.\n",
            "Long-distance relationships thrive and flourish when both people know for sure that their partner is fully on board. Show your partner that youre 100% committed to your relationship by scheduling time to be together, being there when they need you, and addressing any issues rather than giving up on the relationship right away.[5]Commitment is also about not putting yourself in situations that could jeopardize your relationship. For example, if you know youre going out to a club, be sure to not flirt with other people.Its also important that you and your partner trust each other and have faith that neither of you will do anything to threaten your relationship.\n",
            "Decide on an end date for your long-distance relationship.\n",
            "This end goal refers to when you and your partner will finally be able to be physically near each other and continue your relationship in person. Talk to your partner about where they see your relationship going and come up with a general timeline of when you can take your relationship to the next phase.For example, you might agree to move to where they are within the next 2 years provided that your career allows for such a move.If you dont see your relationship working out in the future, be honest with your partner and tell them you think it might be best to end things after a while.\n",
            "Tackle problems together as they happen to bolster your relationship.\n",
            "Since you may not see your partner every day, it can be easy to simply ignore problems for a while. However, when these issues remain unsolved, frustration and resentment can easily begin to build up. Thats why its incredibly important to have a serious conversation about your relationship whenever you feel unhappy or dissatisfied with something.[6]When talking to your partner, use I language to keep the focus on your feelings and perspective and avoid sounding like youre blaming your partner.For example, instead of saying, You never call me first and its annoying, say, Ive been feeling a bit lonely recently and would like if we could talk more.\n",
            "Live your own life and pursue your passions outside of the relationship.\n",
            "Healthy relationships, whether long-distance or not, all require partners to maintain a sense of independence and personal freedom. This allows each person to grow and bring new energy to the relationship. Instead of constantly thinking about your partner and how far away they are, get out and do things that make you happy, then go back to your partner and tell them all about what you did.[7]For example, set aside time to pursue your hobbies during the week.Or, just spend some time relaxing on your own by reading a book, going for a walk, or even meditating to clear your mind.\n",
            "Stay connected with the other important people in your life.\n",
            "While having your partner be so far away may not be the ideal situation, dont forget that you have plenty of other people near you who you can turn to for support and comfort. Avoid letting yourself get wrapped up in your romantic relationship and be sure to spend time with friends and family to nurture those relationships as well.[8]For example, hang out with friends on the weekend, get together for a meal with your family, or take a trip with your closest pals.Dont hesitate to turn to friends and family for relationship advice.\n",
            "Remind yourself that long-distance can be hard, and that's OK.\n",
            "While there are plenty of things you can do to make your long-distance relationship work, its important to stay realistic and acknowledge that challenges that you wouldnt experience in a close-distance relationship might come up. This will help you better prepare to tackle these challenges head-on rather than give up as soon as something goes wrong.Remember that all relationships take some amount of work. Just because you might hit a rough patch every now and then doesnt mean your relationship isnt worth it.\n",
            "Think about the advantages of a long-distance relationship.\n",
            "If you find yourself having doubts about your long-distance relationship, remind yourself of all of the good things that can come from it. For example, studies have shown that long-distance couples actually experience more intimacy and stronger emotional connections. Also, tell yourself daily about what you love about your partner to remind yourself why its all worth it.If anything, the distance between you and your partner will allow you to be more creative in expressing affection toward each other.The success of your relationship partly depends on your attitude. If you tell yourself that things will work out, youll be more motivated to make sure that that comes true.\n",

            "Examine your budget to determine a price range.\n",
            "The first step to moving into your own place is figuring out what you can afford. If you have a job lined up, look at how much youll be making and compare it with your expected expenses. Figure out how much you can afford to spend on rent and still have money to spare for other things. A generally good rule is that your annual (yearly) income should be 40 times the monthly rent. For example, if your rent is 550 then you should probably make at least 22,000 a year or more.  [1]Keep in mind that you may need to save a little extra money for the initial move. Most apartments require a security deposit (usually equal to the rent amount). A lot of places also require first month's rent, and sometimes even last month's rent depending on the landlord. You may also need to pay for a moving van or a professional moving service.Some apartments have income requirements for their tenants (e.g., you must earn 3 times the cost of rent each month). If you cant meet those income requirements, you might be able to get around them by using a cosigner.In addition to rent, common living expenses include transportation costs (e.g., gas and car maintenance), groceries and dining, home utilities (e.g., water, electricity, gas, Internet, and TV), and your phone bill. You may also have other expenses, such as student loan payments or credit card payments.\n",

            "Figure out what you want from your location.\n",
            "In addition to thinking about the apartment itself, youll also need to consider the area where your future apartment is located. Write down a few things you want out of your ideal area or neighborhood.For example, do you need to live relatively close to where youre working or going to school? Do you want to live near amenities like grocery stores or retail outlets? Do you prefer a more urban setting, or something more secluded? Do you want a place thats bike friendly or has good public transit?\n",

            "Begin searching as far in advance as possible.\n",
            "It can take a long time to find a place that fits your needs, so dont start apartment hunting at the last minute. Start your search at least a month before you plan to move. This will give you plenty of time to find and secure an apartment, and also to prepare for the actual move.[4]Summer (between May and August) is the busiest time for move-ins, so avoid the summer rush by moving at a different time of the year, if you can.\n",

            "Once youve narrowed down your search to a few promising options, do some research. Look for reviews written by current or previous tenants on websites like Apartmentratings.com or Apartmentguide.com. If you see a lot of negative reviews for a property, proceed with caution.\n",
            "Set up a time to view potential apartments.\n",
            "Call the property manager or landlord to make an appointment. Seeing the apartment in person will not only give you an idea of whether you like the place, but can also give you a sense of what the management is like.Bring a list of questions to ask the landlord or property manager (e.g., Who do I call if something breaks in my apartment? or How does trash pickup work?).If you can, have a chat with another tenant while youre there. Ask them how they like the place and if theyve encountered any major problems during their time there.\n",
            "Review the rules and policies with management.\n",
            "Before you make a firm decision, take some time to make sure you know what you are getting into.

            "Fill out any required paperwork.\n",
            "Before you can move in to a new apartment, you will have to fill out a few forms. You will likely need to submit to a credit check or background check before you can be approved for a lease, and your new landlord might also ask you to supply a list of references. Be prepared to provide supporting documents, such as:Proof of employment or income, such as recent pay stubs or W2 forms. If you are about to start a new job, you may need a letter from your new employer.Your photo ID.Personal references (e.g., from professors or employers).Information about your co-signer, if you have one. This may be necessary if you have poor credit, no credit history, or dont meet the minimum income requirement for the apartment.\n",
            "Pay any required fees.\n",
            "Many apartments require a fee for your application and credit check. These fees can range from $15-20 sometimes coming up to $100 or more in the U.S.[6] If you wont be moving into your apartment right away, your landlord may also ask you to pay a deposit so they can hold your apartment while youre getting ready to move in.If you are approved, you may need to pay additional fees, such as a security deposit or pet deposit.Check the laws in your area to make sure the landlord or management company is not charging you illegal fees. For example, in Boston, it is illegal for landlords to charge application fees, credit check fees, finders fees, or a fee for holding an apartment.[7]\n",

            "Once youre approved for an apartment, youll be given a lease or rental agreement. Before signing, review your lease to make sure you understand the terms. Read the fine print carefully, and bring up any concerns you have with the landlord or property manager. If you have the means to do so, it's also worth considering having an attorney take a look at the lease. They can help you renegotiate/understand it. [8]\n",
            "Do a walk-through with the landlord and note any problems.\n",
            "Doing a walk-through can help you spot any issues that need to be resolved right away. It is also helpful to have a record of any problems that were present before you moved in. That way, youll be able to prove to your landlord that you are not responsible for these problems when you move out. Look for issues like:Insufficient safety features (such as smoke detectors and fire extinguishers)Signs of leaky plumbingDamage to appliances or fixturesDoors that dont close or lock properlyLight fixtures or outlets that dont work\n",
            "Set up your utilities\n",
            ". Before you move in, contact your local utility companies and set up a time to have your utilities activated. Its a good idea to do this a few weeks in advance. You may need to be present for some utility hookups, so let the utility companies know when you will be moving in and schedule the hookups at a time when you can be there. Make sure that, at minimum, you will have electricity, water and gas set up at move-in time. Ask your landlord or property manager which companies supply these basic utilities to your apartment building.You will also need to look into setting up Internet, phone lines (if you need a landline), and TV service (if you want it). Ask your landlord for advice, or do an online search for providers that serve your area.\n",
            "Get your keys.\n",
            "Your landlord or property manager should provide keys on your move-in date. In addition to your apartment key, you may also receive keys for the main entrance, storage areas, laundry room, or other common areas.Its a good idea to have extra copies of at least your main apartment key and the key that lets you into the building. Go to a locksmith, hardware store, or key-cutting kiosk to get an extra set of keys made. Leave the keys with a friend or family member you trust in case of an emergency.\n",
            "Clean the apartment, if necessary.\n",
            "Many landlords use cleaning services to prepare apartments for new tenants. These services are not always as thorough as you might like, however. It will be easier to do a deep clean before you move all your stuff in, so take a look around and tidy up any problem areas first.If youre concerned about pests, talk to your landlord or property manager about fumigating the apartment or bringing in an exterminator before you move in.\n",
            "File a change of address form with the post office.\n",
            "Once youre established in your new apartment, youll need to make sure that your mail gets sent there instead of to your old address. Go to your postal services website and submit a change of address form online, or go to your local post office and pick up a paper form.If your apartment building does not have a secure area for mail delivery, check with your local post office about setting up a P.O. box instead.\n",
            "Go through your belongings and decide what you want to bring.\n",

Try an exchange website like Freecycle.org, or go to a local bookstore, grocery store, or liquor store to see if they have boxes to spare.[9]Try to pack heavier items, like books, in smaller boxes. Otherwise, you might end up with a bunch of boxes that are too heavy to move!Youll also need packaging tape and padding material (such as bubble wrap, foam peanuts, or wadded-up newspaper).\n",
            "Label the boxes so you know whats in them.\n",
            "When youre packing a bunch of stuff, it can be easy to lose track of whats in which box.

This can help you keep track of your boxes and make sure none of them get lost in the shuffle.\n",
            "Prepare any large furniture items for transportation.\n",
            "Depending on the size of your furniture and how sturdy it is, some pieces may need special preparation. For example, if you are moving a chest of drawers, consider wrapping it in plastic wrap to protect the chest and keep the drawers in place.Some items may need to be partially disassembled for easier transport and move-in (e.g., you might need to take the legs off your couch to get it through the apartment door). Put any loose parts in a bag, and tape it to the furniture.Wrap any fragile items in moving blankets or furniture pads to protect them from bumps and scratches.\n",
            "Ask friends or family members to help you move.\n",
            "Moving all your stuff on your own can be extremely difficult. If you can, recruit some family members or a few friends to help you out. If you get friends to help you, you might even offer to pay them a little bit or treat them to dinner afterwards.If you dont have any friends or family who can help you, consider hiring professional movers. Be sure to do your research and read online reviews of any companies you are considering, so that you know they are trustworthy.\n",
            "Transport your belongings to your new apartment.\n",
            "Rent a moving van, if necessary. Even if you dont have a lot of stuff, you might find it hard to fit it all into the family car. Renting a van or truck can be especially helpful if youre moving long-distance and cant make multiple trips to bring over all your belongings.Search online for truck rental companies in your area, and read up on their terms and prices. Look for online reviews to determine if the company is reliable and trustworthy.When you rent the truck, speak with the rental agent to make sure you understand all rental requirements, including when and how to return the vehicle when you are done.\n",
            "Move boxes into the rooms where the contents belong.\n",
            "Once youve gotten your belongings to the new apartment, put the boxes into the appropriate rooms. This will make the unpacking process much easier.For example, move any boxes containing dishes, food, or cooking supplies into the kitchen. Put your bed linens and clothing in the bedroom.\n",
            "Make a list of items you need, but dont already have.\n",
            "If youre moving into your first apartment, youll likely need to buy quite a few necessities. Go through your new apartment room by room, and try to think of everything that you will need for each room. These might include things like:Major furniture items, such as a bed, a couch or futon, a dining table and chairs, and a desk.Kitchen items and appliances, such as cooking utensils, pots and pans, a microwave, a kettle, a toaster, cups, glasses and cutlery.Smaller necessities, such as shower curtains and curtain liners, trash cans and extension cords, and a closet organizer for your bedroom.Cleaning supplies, such as a vacuum cleaner, broom and dustpan, mop and bucket, sponges, toilet brush, and soaps and detergents.Hygiene basics, like towels, bath soap, hand soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, and toilet paper.\n",
            "Save money by buying items second-hand.\n",

            "If you plan on binge watching a show, you need to make sure you dont have any other pressing priorities for the rest of the day. You might tell yourself that youll still make it to dinner with your friends at 8, but when youre 5 episodes deep into Game of Thrones and its time to get ready, youll wish you had cancelled.[1]The amount of time youll need depends on how long the show is. Some single-season shows can be finished in just a couple of hours, but longer-running shows could take multiple binging sessions over several weeks.\n",
            "Find a comfy spot.\n",
            "Youre going to be hanging out here for awhile, so pick somewhere that will allow you to shift your position to keep you comfortable. Try binge-watching on your couch or in a reclining chair. If possible, watch on an actual TV instead of on a computer or mobile device to reduce eye strain.[2]As tempting as it may be to binge every season of Orange is the New Black while youre sitting in your bed, watching TV in bed can lead to insomnia. The blue light from screens mimics that of sunlight, tricking your brain into feeling more awake.[3]\n",
            "Stock up on snacks.\n",
            "Youll need to stay hydrated and nourished through your binge-watching session, so make sure your fridge is stocked with some of your faves. To avoid racking up extra calories, keep healthy snacks like fruits, nuts, and low-fat popcorn on hand.[4]Portion out less healthy snacks like chips into plastic bags beforehand so you dont eat too much at one time.\n",
            "Use a binge-watching session as an opportunity to drink more water.\n",

Just be sure to cancel when your trial is up to avoid having any charges put on your card.\n",

            "If you don't want to sign up for a free trial, ask a friend with a streaming service to binge watch with you. Watching a show is usually more fun with someone else, anyway. Make sure your friend hasn't seen the show so that they don't spoil it for you, unless your friend can watch the show again without spoiling it. It is also fun to have a group binge watching together to make sure you don't fall asleep or miss anything.\n",
            "Check your local cable listings for marathons of shows.\n",
            "Cable channels will often air several episodes of a show, especially right before a new season of that show airs. If you have a DVR, set it up to record so you can watch the show at your leisure. If you don't, just plan to binge watch when it airs!\n",

Make the most of it by having your food delivered during your binge-watching session.If youve been snacking on healthy treats, go ahead and splurge a little with Chinese take-out or a pizza. Other foods include ramen noodles, Totinos pizza rolls, and maybe some sushi.Check to see if theres a meal delivery service like Waitr or Uber Eats in your area to have a dish from your favorite local spot delivered right to your door!\n",

            "Binge watching TV can slow your metabolism, which can lead to a whole host of health problems. Fight this by staying active while you watch your show. Get up and stretch between episodes, hit pause after a great scene, or do chores like folding laundry or washing dishes.[5]Even just a 1-minute workout can help combat some of the effects of a sedentary lifestyle.

            "While each community has its own codes for building chimneys, most codes are based on the National Fire Protection Agencies 211 standard. Go to the NFPA website to review national fire code associated with chimneys. The code is available online for free.[1] This code should guide all aspects of the function of your chimney.Two general requirements of the 211 standard are that chimneys be at least 3 feet (90 centimeters) taller than the highest point where it goes through the roof of a single structure and 2 feet (60 centimeters) taller than any portion of the building or any adjacent building within 10 feet (3 meters) of the chimney. The taller the chimney, the better it drafts.A chimney also needs at least a 2-inch (5-centimeter) clearance from combustible material if it is built in or through the walls of a house and a 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) clearance if built alongside the house.\n",
            "Decide what material the chimney will be made of.\n",
            "The most common material for a chimney is brick or masonry, but prefabricated metal chimneys are also widely available. If building a masonry or brick chimney, you will need to figure out how big it will be to estimate how many bricks to order. If using a prefab metal chimney, you will need to measure the distance from your stove, or other appliance, to the location where it is exiting the house.Masonry chimneys are usually required to have walls at least 4-inches (10-centimeters) thick. Standard chimney bricks should come in this thickness.\n",

            "This will determine whether your chimney can vent multiple appliances or if it will vent only one.It is possible to build chimneys for several appliances and connect them to a main discharge flue, sized to handle the combined output, provided the subordinate flues for the individual chimneys are not angled more than 30 degrees off vertical and they vent the same type of by-product. In other words, a chimney for a gas range can be combined with one for a gas furnace, but not a wood-burning fireplace.Flues also must not change in shape or size within 6 inches (15 centimeters) above or below a floor, ceiling or roof made of combustible materials.\n",
            "Determine the width of the chimney flue.\n",
            "This is mostly determined by what appliance(s) the chimney is built to vent. Metal chimneys are usually round flue pipes, while masonry chimneys usually have square or rectangular flues. Each type has different diameter requirements depending on what they are venting. Consult local and national fire code to determine the diameter you should use.Masonry chimneys are typically lined with a clay or ceramic tile flue, which goes up the center of the brick chimney with a gap between the outside brick and the inside flue, so that the ceramic or clay flue is able to expand and contract without moving the brick. However, stainless steel pipe or concrete may also be used in some cases, depending on what the chimney is designed to vent.Look at local building code to determine the size flue that is required for the appliance you are venting. These differ, so make sure to check for your specific need.\n",
            "Buy all supplies needed for building your chimney.\n",
            "While this will vary a bit, depending on the type and location of your chimney, you should have all supplies on hand when starting your project.When installing a metal chimney you will need flashing, prefab chimney box, chimney cap, prefab chimney sections, and chimney roof braces. When passing through a wall or ceiling, you should use a section of chimney that is rated as a wall pass through, so that there is no risk of your wall or roof catching on fire.When building a masonry chimney you will need to buy the brick and masonry, mortar, support pieces (such as rebar), flashing, a cap, and specialty masonry tools.\n",
            "Build the smoke chamber.\n",
            "You will need to start building your chimney from the ground up. For a masonry chimney, this usually means that you will be building your chimney right off the top of a fireplace (if the chimney is designed to vent a fireplace), using a brick that is similar to that used to build the hearth.You will need to mix your mortar mix with water, making it the consistency of thick peanut butter. Once it is the right consistency, you will use a mason's trowel to load mortar onto each brick before you set it in place. You need to put enough mortar on each brick so that it oozes out the joints a bit, which guarantees that the entire area between the bricks is filled with mortar.As you build up the walls of the chimney with bricks, make sure that it is level on all planes. Take a level and check that all walls are level on their vertical and horizontal planes, and that in each line of bricks all the bricks are lined up with the other.For a prefabricated metal fireplace, the smoke chamber is almost indistinguishable from the rest of the chimney.The chimney should be built on a very solid base. If you are not building on an existing fireplace or base, you may need to pour a reinforced concrete pad for the chimney to be built upon. Consult local code to determine if it is required and what specifications it should be built to.\n",
            "Construct the flue and outside of chimney.\n",
            "The flue connects the top of the smoke chamber to the roof through the middle of the chimney. As noted in the previous section, it may be made of either brick or metal pipe. If clay or ceramic tiles are used to create the flue in a brick chimney, they are laid as the exterior of the chimney is put up.Metal liners can be dropped into place, while concrete liners are cast in place by pouring concrete through a flexible hose. For more information on how to install a chimney liner see: How to Install a Chimney Liner.\n",
            "Surround the chimney with flashing where it goes through any walls.\n",
            "You'll want to put metal flashing around the chimney in 2 places: around the chimney where it meets the roof and as a lining underneath the chimney cap. Use a waterproof silicone caulk or polyurethane caulk underneath the flashing to keep water from leaking into the house around the chimney.[2]\n",
            "Cap the chimney.\n",
            "The chimney cap goes over the top of the brick flue housing. It should extend past the chimney wall by at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) and have a drip edge to channel water away from the chimney. Recommended chimney cap materials include stone and concrete either pre-cast or cast in place.For more information on how to cap a chimney see: How to Cap a Chimney.A chimney cap is important because it will reduce the amount of moisture that can get down your chimney, keep out animals, block downdrafts, stop sparks from leaving your chimney and also block debris, like leaves and branches, from going down your chimney.[3]\n",

Additionally, it shows your teacher that youre ready to learn, which helps you have a great reputation. Read your syllabus or talk to your teacher to make sure you have the items you need every day.[2]For instance, always have a writing utensil, something to write on, and your text. If your school allows electronics, bring your laptop or tablet for note taking.If you cant afford your class materials, thats okay! Talk to your teacher to find out how you can get help getting the supplies you need to be successful.\n",
            "Read the texts your teacher assigns before class.\n",
            "You probably have a ton of stuff to do, so you might be tempted to skip the readings your teacher assigns. However, this can make it hard for you to learn the material. Always do your assigned readings before the day of class so youre fully prepared to discuss the subject matter.[3]Reading the text ahead of time also allows you to figure out what you dont understand so you can ask questions in class.\n",
            "Make notes on the reading to use during class discussions.\n",
            "If youre allowed to mark up your book, highlight important passages and make notes. If you cant write in your book or have a digital book, write your notes in your notebook. Review your notes before class so that you have something to say during the class discussion.[4]As an example, you might write, The weather seems to represent the main characters mood, or The two generals could have won the battle if theyd worked together instead of against each other.Its also helpful to write down questions that you want to ask. For instance, you might plan to ask, Is the star in this story a symbol? What does it symbolize?\n",
            "Ask questions about material you dont understand.\n",
            "[5] You may feel embarrassed when you dont understand something, but its normal to have questions. In fact, it shows everyone that youre a good student who wants to learn! If you have a question, ask it during class or talk to your teacher after class.[6]Its best to ask questions during class. You might even be helping your classmates who have the same question.If youre too shy to ask, stay for a few minutes after class, talk to your teacher after school, or send your teacher an email.\n",
            "Take good notes\n",
            "during class lectures or discussions. Class discussions and lectures have a lot of important information that will help you understand your coursework. Write down the topics your teacher highlights in class. Additionally, note the important details they focus on during the class discussion.[7]As an example, write down important names, dates, and concepts in history class. When studying literature, take notes about topics like theme and literary devices that the author uses, such as symbolism or metaphor.Your teacher will likely pull a lot of their test questions from the class discussion, so good notes can help you ace your exams.\n",
            "Schedule time for homework and studying into your routine.\n",
            "Its important that you take time to study and do your homework daily so that its a habit. Pick a time that works best for you, such as right after school, during study hall, or in the morning before school. Then, dedicate this time to your homework or study sessions.[8]For instance, you might set aside 30 minutes before school and 1 hour every evening after dinner.You might have days when you have less homework. Use these days to review your notes, make flashcards, or start preparing for a test.\n",
            "Create a distraction-free study environment.\n",
            "Pick a spot that feels comfortable and serves as a good workspace, like a desk in your bedroom or your kitchen table. Turn off your electronics or remove them from your study space, and get rid of other distractions, as well.[9] Then, put the items that you need for studying nearby.[10]For instance, place writing utensils and paper in your workspace so you always have them.\n",

Additionally, itll help you avoid getting behind when youre having a busy week.\n",
            "Break bigger assignments into smaller chunks so theyre easier to do.\n",
            "Its normal to feel overwhelmed by major assignments, like essays, projects, and tests. To make them easier, break them up into smaller, easy-to-accomplish steps.[12] Then, check off each step so that its easier to get your assignment done.[13]Start working on your assignment as soon as you get it instead of waiting until right before its due.For instance, let's say your teacher assigns a research paper that's due in 3 weeks. You might pick your topic on the day you get the assignment. Then, spend 2-3 days doing initial research before writing your thesis statement. Next, you could give yourself a week to do more research and write a first draft, then another week to do revisions. This leaves you 2-3 days to proofread and finalize your paper.As another example, let's say you have a week to build a molecule for science class. You might spend the first day researching the molecule you plan to build. On day 2, you might sketch the molecule and buy your supplies. Then, you could build the model over the next 5 days.\n",
            "Use a planner\n",
            "to keep track of assignment due dates.[14] Your workload will likely increase as the school year progresses, and its easy to lose track of when assignments are due. Write down every assignment that you receive and its due date. Additionally, add study and homework goals to your planner. This will help you stay on top of your school work.[15]You can buy a planner or make your own.\n",
            "Organize your class materials in a binder, folder, or notebook.\n",
            "Keep your handouts, assignments, and notes in a 3-ring binder or folder. Additionally, store your digital files on your computer, in a Google Drive, or on a flash drive. If you prefer, write your class notes in a spiral notebook. Sort through these items weekly to make sure they stay organized.[16]If you work on different computers, use a flash drive or Google Drive to make it easier to access your files from any computer.Dont throw away your classwork until the end of the year. Instead, leave your work in your class folder or in a folder that you keep at home. This way you can go back and study it if you need to do so.\n",
            "Turn in your assignments on time so you get full credit.\n",
            "You work hard on your school work, so you want to get the credit you deserve. Make sure you always turn in your assignments on time so you dont lose points for being late. This includes both homework and major assignments, like essays or projects.[17]Sometimes you might have a legitimate excuse for being late, such as a major illness. If this happens, talk to your teacher before the assignment is due so you can get an extension. This way you can still get full credit for your work.\n",
            "Join a study group\n",
            "to share knowledge and ideas. Studying with your peers allows you all to learn better. You can share your knowledge and get tips from your classmates.

            "Attend tutoring if you need help understanding a topic.\n",

            "Identify widespread pain across the lower back and the buttocks.\n",
            "If you are having pain across these areas, it is most likely caused by an injury to the back muscles, not the kidneys. These are common areas of back pain and it is more common for back pain to spread across this whole region than for kidney pain to spread in this way.An injury to the back muscles can impact the function and pain levels in a variety of muscles down the backside of the body, including the gluteus muscles.If you are having widespread pain, weakness, or numbness, especially down into your legs, it is important to get medical care immediately.[1]\n",
            "Feel for pain specifically between the ribs and hips.\n",
            "Kidney pain is most often located on the side or the back in the area called the flank. This is the area at the back of the body where the kidneys are located.[2]Pain in other areas of the back, such as the upper back, is not caused by the kidneys.\n",
            "Identify abdominal pain.\n",
            "If the pain in your lower back is accompanied by pain in your abdomen, then it is more likely that your pain is related to your kidneys. Back pain tends to remain on the back side of the body. Enlarged or infected kidneys can cause inflammation towards the front of the body in addition to the back.[3]If you only have abdominal pain with no back pain, that is not likely to be related to the kidneys.\n",
            "Assess whether the pain is constant.\n",
            "In many cases, kidney pain is constant. It may decrease or increase a bit throughout the day, but it never goes away completely. On the other hand, back pain will often go away completely and then come back at a later time.[4]Most causes of kidney pain, including urinary tract infections and kidney stones, will not stop hurting on their own without treatment. The back muscles, on the other hand, can heal themselves and the pain can go away.Some kidney stones can pass through your body on their own without treatment.[5] However, it is still important to get the cause of your kidney pain evaluated by a doctor.\n",
            "Feel for pain on only one side of your lower back.\n",
            "If you are having pain on just one side of your flank, then it is likely that it is caused by your kidney. The kidneys are located right along the flank and a kidney stone may only cause pain in one of your kidneys.[6]\n",
            "Think about likely causes of back pain.\n",
            "One way to distinguish between back and kidney pain is to think about whether you have done anything recently that is likely to cause back pain. If you have done a lot of heavy lifting or have bent over for a long period of time, your pain is more likely to be back pain than kidney pain.If you stood or sat for an unusually long time recently that could cause back pain.Also, if you have an existing injury to your back it is likely that new pain is related to that previous injury.\n",
            "Pay attention to problems with urination.\n",
            "Because the kidneys are an integral part of the urinary tract, infections and other problems with the kidneys often show up during urination. Look for blood in your urine and pay attention to increases in pain when you urinate.[7]Your urine may also be cloudy or dark if the pain is coming from your kidneys.You may also feel an intense need to urinate when you are having kidney problems, such as kidney stones.[8]\n",
            "Feel for numbness below the back.\n",
            "In some cases of back pain you may experience numbness due to problems with nerve compression and blood flow down into the buttocks and the legs. This is a common symptom for those suffering from back pain related to the sciatic nerve.[9]This numbness can even go all the way down to the toes in extreme cases.\n",
            "Contact your doctor if you have pain that won't go away.\n",
            "It is important to get medical problems that are causing you pain treated by a medical professional. If you don't get them treated promptly, they could create larger issues that will cause you even more pain in the future.Call your doctor's office and describe your symptoms to the office staff. They will then suggest an appointment time for you to be seen.Treating pain with an over-the-counter pain medication is a good temporary solution if you are in a lot of distress. However, you should get medical care for long-term pain so that there is a chance that the problem can be solved instead of simply masked with medication.\n",
            "Have an examination and testing done.\n",
            "When you see the doctor they will ask you about your symptoms, including when they started and how strong they are. They will then do a physical exam that includes feeling the areas of pain. At this point they may be able to give you a general idea of what is causing the pain but they will also likely do a variety of tests on you to give you a specific diagnosis.Whether the doctor suspects a serious problem in the back, such as a slipped disc, or a problem with the kidneys, they will order imaging to be done. This can be in the form of an X-ray, ultrasound, spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or a computed tomography (CT) scan.[10]If the doctor suspects a problem with your kidneys, they will order a variety of blood and urine tests to look for abnormalities in your blood cell counts and your protein counts, among other things.\n",
            "Treat the cause of your pain.\n",
            "Once the cause of your pain has been identified, your doctor will suggest a treatment plan. This plan should address both the pain you are experiencing and the cause of the pain. This means that you are likely to be prescribed a pain reliever and a medication to treat any infections or injuries you have sustained.If you are having kidney pain due to kidney stones, a common cause of kidney pain, your doctor will prescribe medication for pain and discuss surgical options with you if the stones are large and won't pass.[11]If you have a pulled back muscle, a common cause of back pain, your doctor will likely talk to you about pain management, care for the muscles, and physical therapy options.[12]\n",
